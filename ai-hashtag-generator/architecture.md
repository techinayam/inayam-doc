## AI Hashtag Generator Architecture

### Overview
The AI Hashtag Generator leverages OpenAI's GPT model to generate relevant hashtags based on the user's input text. The application is built using Next.js with TypeScript and LangChain to handle OpenAI API interactions.

### Components

- **Next.js**: Handles the frontend and backend logic, including routing and API requests.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the project.
- **LangChain**: Provides integration with the OpenAI API for language model operations.
- **OpenAI API**: Used to generate hashtags from input text.

### Workflow

1. **User Input**: Users provide input text (up to 75 characters).
2. **API Request**: The input is sent to the backend API, which uses LangChain to interact with OpenAI.
3. **Hashtag Generation**: OpenAI generates hashtags based on the input text.
4. **Display**: The generated hashtags are displayed on the UI.

### Token Management
A maximum token limit of 75 is enforced to ensure optimal performance and to stay within OpenAI usage limits.
