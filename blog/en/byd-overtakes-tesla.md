### BYD's Meteoric Rise

Founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu, BYD initially focused on manufacturing rechargeable batteries. Transitioning to automotive production in 2005, the company has experienced exponential growth, particularly in the EV sector. In the first half of 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's largest plug-in electric vehicle manufacturer, selling 641,000 vehicles. By 2023, BYD became China's top-selling car brand, overtaking Volkswagenâ€”a position Volkswagen had held since the liberalization of the Chinese automotive industry.

### Tesla's Response and Market Challenges
