## Understanding the Basics: What Are ITR Filing Due Dates?

Before diving into the dates, a quick refresher: The financial year (FY) runs from **April 1st to March 31st**. For FY 2024-2025, that means April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025.

## Final Thoughts

Remember, the **key to smooth tax filing** is preparation and punctuality. Keep your documents handy and mark those calendars with the due dates:

- **September 30, 2025** – Audit cases and certain taxpayers
- **November 30, 2025** – Transfer pricing cases and international transactions

Missing these can be costly, so mark your calendars and maybe set reminders on your phone.
