## Trump Reciprocal Tax and Its Impact on Global Trade: Focus on India

On April 2, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a reciprocal tariff policy aimed at addressing perceived unfair trade practices by imposing tariffs on imports equivalent to those that American exports face in foreign markets. While the policy is viewed as a strategic move to level the playing field, it raises significant concerns, especially for countries like India that are heavily dependent on exports to the U.S.

### **Trump's 26% Reciprocal Tariff on India**

India, one of the world’s largest emerging markets, has been directly affected by Trump’s new policy. The U.S. has slapped a 26% tariff on all Indian goods entering the country. This move is part of a broader strategy by Trump to resolve trade imbalances, with the U.S. accusing India of charging disproportionately high tariffs on American goods, including automobiles, dairy products, and steel.

In response to the new tariffs, Indian businesses are scrambling to understand the full impact on their exports. Several key sectors, including pharmaceuticals, IT, and automotive, are likely to be severely affected. India’s $46 billion trade deficit with the U.S. has fueled this move, and the tariffs will remain in place until India revises its tariff policies.

### **Sector-Wise Impact**

The 26% tariff will impact India’s key export sectors, including:

- **Automobiles**: Indian automobile exports, particularly from companies like Tata Motors and Sona Comstar, are expected to face a significant decline in demand due to increased costs for American consumers.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: The U.S. is one of the largest importers of Indian pharmaceutical products. An increase in tariffs could lead to a decrease in the export revenue for this sector, affecting both small and large pharmaceutical companies in India.
- **Information Technology (IT)**: India’s massive IT outsourcing industry could face challenges as the U.S. may impose tariffs on IT services. This would increase operational costs for U.S. companies outsourcing services to India.

### **Reciprocal Tax by Country**

Below is a table listing the reciprocal tariffs that Trump’s policy would impose on different countries:

| South Africa      | 30%                     |
| Brazil            | 10%                     |
| Bangladesh        | 37%                     |
| Singapore         | 10%                     |
| Israel            | 17%                     |
| Philippines       | 17%                     |

| Colombia          | 10%                     |

### **India’s Response and Strategy**

In the wake of the 26% tariff, India is exploring ways to mitigate the impact. This could include reducing tariffs on U.S. goods, such as pharmaceuticals, auto parts, and jewelry, in hopes of softening the trade blow. However, no formal deal has been finalized, and India remains in negotiations with the U.S. to address the situation.

India’s strategic sectors like IT services, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles face immediate consequences, but the broader impact on the Indian economy depends on the duration of these tariffs and the overall economic relations between the two countries.

### **Conclusion**

The imposition of the Reciprocal Tax by Trump is a bold move to address trade imbalances, but it could have far-reaching effects on global trade dynamics, particularly for countries like India. While India continues to negotiate its position, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining how the global trade landscape evolves under these new conditions.

As the situation develops, businesses and policymakers worldwide must adapt to the new realities of international trade, ensuring that the broader objectives of fair trade and economic growth are maintained despite the challenges posed by reciprocal tariffs.
