## Introduction

TypeScript continues to evolve, bringing better tools and practices to write robust applications. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best practices that will help you write cleaner, more maintainable code in TypeScript.

## 1. Use Strict Mode

TypeScript’s strict mode enables several compiler options that make the language safer and more predictable. Enabling strict mode forces you to be explicit with types, preventing potential errors in your code.

To enable strict mode, add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
