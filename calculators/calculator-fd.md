## FD Calculator

## Definition
A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that offers investors a higher interest rate than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. The investor deposits a lump sum amount for a fixed period, and the interest earned on the deposit is paid at maturity or at regular intervals.

## Formula to Calculate FD Maturity Amount

The formula to calculate the maturity amount for a Fixed Deposit is:

\[
M = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- **M** = Maturity Amount
- **P** = Principal Amount (initial deposit)
- **r** = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal)
- **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- **t** = Time in years

### Example:

If you invest ₹1,00,000 at an annual interest rate of 6% compounded quarterly for 3 years, the maturity amount can be calculated as:

\[
M = 1,00,000 \times \left(1 + \frac{0.06}{4}\right)^{4 \times 3}
\]

By solving, you'll get a maturity amount of approximately ₹1,19,101.64.
