# RD Calculator

## Definition
A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a financial product offered by banks and financial institutions that allows individuals to deposit a fixed amount regularly for a specified tenure. It combines the benefits of regular savings with the option of earning higher interest rates similar to Fixed Deposits. RDs are ideal for individuals who want to save a small amount periodically and earn interest on their deposits.

## Formula to Calculate RD Maturity Amount

The formula to calculate the maturity amount for a Recurring Deposit is:

\[
M = P \times \frac{(1 + r/n)^{nt} - 1}{(r/n)} \times (1 + r/n)
\]

Where:
- **M** = Maturity Amount
- **P** = Monthly Deposit Amount
- **r** = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal)
- **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year (usually 12 for monthly)
- **t** = Time in years

### Example:

If you deposit ₹5,000 per month for 5 years at an annual interest rate of 7% compounded monthly, the maturity amount can be calculated as:

\[
M = 5000 \times \frac{(1 + \frac{0.07}{12})^{12 \times 5} - 1}{\frac{0.07}{12}} \times (1 + \frac{0.07}{12})
\]

By solving, you'll get a maturity amount of approximately ₹3,70,918.64.

## Use of the Formula
