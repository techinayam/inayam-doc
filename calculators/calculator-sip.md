# SIP Calculator

## Definition
A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method of investing a fixed sum regularly in mutual funds. SIP allows investors to purchase units of a particular scheme on a particular date each month. This approach enables investors to take advantage of market volatility through rupee cost averaging and builds a disciplined investment habit.

## Formula to Calculate SIP

The formula to calculate the future value of investments made through SIP is:

\[
FV = P \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \times (1 + r)
\]

Where:
- **FV** = Future Value of the investment
- **P** = Amount invested at regular intervals (SIP amount)
- **r** = Expected rate of return (annual rate divided by 12)
- **n** = Total number of investments (months)

### Example:

If you invest ₹5,000 per month for 10 years with an expected annual return of 12%, the future value can be calculated as:

\[
FV = 5000 \times \frac{(1 + \frac{12}{100 \times 12})^{120} - 1}{\frac{12}{100 \times 12}} \times (1 + \frac{12}{100 \times 12})
\]

By solving, you'll get a future value of approximately ₹9,20,000.

## Use of the Formula

- **Investment Planning**: SIP helps investors to plan their investments by providing a clearer view of expected returns based on consistent contributions.
- **Wealth Creation**: The formula aids in estimating how much wealth can be generated over time, helping investors set realistic financial goals.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Regular investments help mitigate risks associated with market volatility, allowing investors to benefit from market ups and downs.
