## Age Calculator: Your Go-To Tool for Accurate Age Calculation

### Definition
The Age Calculator is a powerful online tool designed to help you calculate your exact age based on your birth date. Whether you need to determine your age for personal reasons, official documents, or planning life events, our Age Calculator provides a quick and accurate solution. 

### Formula to Calculate Age
To calculate your age, the formula is simple:
- **Age = Current Date - Birth Date**

This formula takes into account the total number of years, months, and days between your birth date and the current date or any specific date you choose.

### Example Calculation
For instance, if your birth date is January 1, 1990, and today is October 1, 2023, the calculation would be:
- **Age = 2023 - 1990 = 33 years**
- Since the current date is before your birthday in 2024, you would still be 33 years old.

### Use of the Formula
This formula is essential for various applications, such as:
- Determining eligibility for age-restricted activities (e.g., driving, voting).
