## Understanding the BMI Calculator

The **BMI Calculator** is a powerful tool designed to help individuals assess their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight, height, gender, and activity level. By calculating your BMI, you can gain valuable insights into your health and fitness, making it easier to track your progress and set realistic goals.

### Definition of BMI

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height. It serves as a useful guideline to categorize individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity. Understanding your BMI can help you make informed decisions about your health and lifestyle.

### Formula to Calculate BMI

The formula to calculate BMI is:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2} \]

For those using pounds and inches, the formula is:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (lbs)} \times 703}{\text{Height (in)}^2} \]

### Example Calculation

For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 m tall, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{70}{1.75^2} = 22.86 \]

This value indicates that you fall within the "normal weight" category.

### Use of the Formula

The BMI formula is a straightforward method to evaluate body weight relative to height. It is widely used by healthcare professionals and fitness enthusiasts alike to monitor weight-related health risks. However, it is essential to note that BMI does not account for muscle mass, bone density, or distribution of fat, which can lead to misinterpretations in certain individuals.
