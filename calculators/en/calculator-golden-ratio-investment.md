## Introduction to the Golden Ratio

The **Golden Ratio** is an irrational number, approximately **1.618**, represented by the Greek letter φ (phi). Historically, this ratio appears in art, architecture, and nature, and it represents balance and harmony.

### How It Works in Investing

In investment, the Golden Ratio can be used to allocate assets in a way that balances growth and stability. Here's how it typically works:

- **High-Risk Assets**: 38.2% of the portfolio (based on 1 / φ)
- **Low-Risk Assets**: 61.8% of the portfolio (based on φ - 1)

This allocation helps create a structure that is balanced yet has potential for growth.

## Why Use the Golden Ratio in Investing?

Investors often aim for a portfolio that can withstand volatility while still providing opportunities for growth. The **Golden Ratio** method offers several advantages:

1. **Balanced Growth and Stability**: By splitting your portfolio based on φ, you maintain a balance between higher risk (for growth) and lower risk (for stability).
2. **Systematic Rebalancing**: The ratio guides your rebalancing decisions when investments increase or decrease in value.
3. **Psychological Comfort**: A portfolio aligned with the Golden Ratio is simple and harmonious, which can reduce stress during market fluctuations.
