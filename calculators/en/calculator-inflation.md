## Inflation Calculator: Assessing the Future Value of Your Money

Understanding the impact of inflation on your investments and savings is crucial for effective financial planning. The **Inayam Inflation Calculator** is designed to help you calculate the future value of your money while considering inflation rates. This powerful tool allows you to make informed decisions about your financial future by projecting how inflation will affect your purchasing power over time.

### Definition

An **Inflation Calculator** is a financial tool that estimates the future value of money by accounting for inflation. It helps users understand how inflation erodes purchasing power and allows for better planning regarding investments and savings.

### Formula to Calculate Future Value Adjusted for Inflation

The formula used in the Inflation Calculator is:

\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- **FV** = Future Value
- **PV** = Present Value (initial amount of money)
- **r** = Inflation Rate (as a decimal)
- **n** = Time Period (in years)

### Example Calculation

Let’s say you have a present value of $1,000, an inflation rate of 3% (0.03), and a time period of 5 years. Using the formula:

\[ FV = 1000 \times (1 + 0.03)^5 \]
\[ FV = 1000 \times (1.159274) \]
\[ FV \approx 1159.27 \]

This means that after 5 years, your $1,000 will have a future value of approximately $1,159.27, considering a 3% inflation rate.

### Use of the Formula

The formula is essential for calculating how much your money will be worth in the future after accounting for inflation. This is particularly useful for:
