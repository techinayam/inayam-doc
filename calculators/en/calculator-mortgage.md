## Mortgage Calculator: Your Essential Tool for Financial Planning

### Definition
A Mortgage Calculator is a powerful online tool designed to help individuals calculate their monthly mortgage payments based on various parameters such as principal amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. This tool is essential for anyone looking to understand their financial commitments when purchasing a home.

### Formula to Calculate Mortgage Payments
The formula used to calculate monthly mortgage payments (M) is derived from the loan amount (P), the monthly interest rate (r), and the number of payments (n):

\[ M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1} \]

Where:
- \( M \) = Total monthly mortgage payment
- \( P \) = Principal loan amount
- \( r \) = Monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12)
- \( n \) = Number of payments (loan tenure in months)

### Example Calculation
For instance, if you are looking to borrow $300,000 at an annual interest rate of 4% for 30 years, the monthly interest rate would be \( \frac{4\%}{12} = 0.00333 \) and the total number of payments would be \( 30 \times 12 = 360 \). Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[ M = 300,000 \times \frac{0.00333(1 + 0.00333)^{360}}{(1 + 0.00333)^{360} - 1} \]

This results in a monthly payment of approximately $1,432.25.
