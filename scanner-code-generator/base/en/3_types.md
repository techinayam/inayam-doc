## Types of Scanner Code Generators

### 1D Barcode Generators
1D barcodes, also known as linear barcodes, are the most traditional type of code and are widely used in retail. They consist of a series of parallel black and white lines of varying widths. Each of these lines represents numbers and symbols that can be scanned and interpreted.

**Common 1D Barcode Formats**:
- **UPC (Universal Product Code)**: Widely used in retail for identifying products.
- **EAN (European Article Number)**: A superset of UPC, often used internationally.
- **Code 128**: A high-density barcode used for alphanumeric data encoding.
  
**Advantages**:
- Simple and widely adopted.
- Easy to generate and scan.
  
**Limitations**:
- Limited information storage.
- Susceptible to damage due to its linear nature.

### 2D Barcode Generators (QR Codes)
2D barcodes are a more advanced type of code that can store much more information than traditional 1D barcodes. The most well-known type of 2D barcode is the **QR Code**. These codes can store various types of data, including URLs, text, or contact details, and can be scanned using smartphones and barcode scanners.

**Advantages**:
- Can store large amounts of data.
- Can be scanned from any direction.
- Durable and damage-resistant.

**Popular 2D Codes**:
- **QR Codes**: Used for marketing, ticketing, and digital transactions.
- **Data Matrix**: Used in industrial settings due to its compact size.
- **PDF417**: Often used in logistics and transportation for document scanning.

### RFID and NFC Code Generators
Unlike visual barcodes, **RFID** and **NFC** codes are embedded with information that can be read by specific readers using radio frequency. RFID tags can be either passive (powered by the scanning device) or active (have their own power source).

**Advantages**:
- Does not require line-of-sight scanning.
- Can be scanned over longer distances.
  
**Applications**:
- Inventory tracking.
- Contactless payments.
- Asset management.

### Digital Watermark Generators
Digital watermarks embed hidden, imperceptible information into digital media, such as images, audio, or video. These codes can later be extracted and scanned, providing copyright protection and content tracking.

**Advantages**:
- Invisible to the naked eye.
- Secure and hard to tamper with.
