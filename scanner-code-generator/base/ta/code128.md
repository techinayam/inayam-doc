## Input Options and Examples

Creating a barcode with our Code 128 generator is simple. You just need to enter the data you wish to encode. Letâ€™s take a closer look at some features and examples of using the Code 128 barcode format.

### Sample Input for Code 128

**Code 128** can encode all 128 ASCII characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows for a wide range of applications, from labeling products to inventory tracking.

- **Data:** `HELLO123`
- **Options:** `includetext`, `guardwhitespace`
  
With the above input, the barcode generated will visually represent the alphanumeric input while including the text "HELLO123" below it for easy readability.

### Code 128 Variants and Their Usage

Code 128 has three subsets: Code A, Code B, and Code C, each of which has its specific use cases:

1. **Code A:** This subset includes uppercase letters, control characters, and numbers. It's typically used in applications that only need uppercase encoding.

2. **Code B:** Code 128 B is widely used because it can encode both upper and lower-case letters along with numbers and certain symbols. It's ideal for general retail environments.

3. **Code C:** This is particularly efficient for numeric data and is optimized for encoding even pairs of digits. This makes it the preferred choice for applications such as warehouse management where numeric inventory codes are common.

### Standards and Compliance

The Code 128 barcode format complies with several international standards, including ISO/IEC 15417. By using our generator, you can ensure that your barcodes meet industry standards for readability and accuracy.

### Data and Options

When entering data for your barcode, keep the following options in mind:

- **Data Field:** Code 128 can accept a wide array of inputs from various characters. Ensure the length does not exceed the maximum limit for readability.
  
- **Include Text Option:** By setting this option, the input text will be printed below the barcode, assisting with manual scanning and human readability.

- **Guard Whitespace Option:** This option, when enabled, adds additional whitespace guard marks that improve the ease of scanning.

### Examples

Here are a couple of examples for you to see how the inputs work with the Code 128 generator:

1. **Data:** `1234567890`
   - **Options:** `includetext`
   - **Encoder:** `code128`

2. **Data:** `Sample Product #0023`
   - **Options:** `includetext`, `guardwhitespace`
