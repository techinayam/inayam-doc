## Understanding Degree per Second Squared (°/s²)

### Definition
Degree per second squared (°/s²) is a unit of angular acceleration that measures the rate of change of angular velocity over time. It is commonly used in physics and engineering to describe how quickly an object is rotating or changing its rotational speed.

### Standardization
The degree per second squared is part of the metric system, where angular measurements are standardized to provide consistency across various applications. One degree is defined as 1/360 of a full rotation, making it a practical unit for measuring small changes in rotation.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has been studied for centuries, with roots tracing back to the early works of physicists like Galileo and Newton. The degree as a measurement has evolved, but its application in angular acceleration has remained crucial in fields such as mechanics, robotics, and aerospace engineering.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of degree per second squared, consider an object that increases its rotational speed from 0°/s to 90°/s in 3 seconds. The angular acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Angular Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Final Velocity} - \text{Initial Velocity}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{90°/s - 0°/s}{3s} = 30°/s²
\]

### Use of the Units
Degree per second squared is particularly useful in applications involving rotational motion, such as in the design of motors, gyroscopes, and various mechanical systems. It helps engineers and scientists quantify how quickly an object is accelerating in a rotational context.
