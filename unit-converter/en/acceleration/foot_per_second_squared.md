## Foot Per Second Squared (ft/s²) Tool Description

### Definition
Foot per second squared (ft/s²) is a unit of acceleration that quantifies the change in velocity of an object over time. Specifically, it measures how many feet an object accelerates each second, per second. This unit is essential in various fields, including physics, engineering, and automotive industries, where understanding acceleration is crucial for safety and performance.

### Standardization
The foot per second squared is part of the Imperial system of units, which is commonly used in the United States. It is standardized in relation to the meter per second squared (m/s²), which is the SI (International System of Units) unit for acceleration. To convert between these two units, you can use the conversion factor: 1 ft/s² is approximately equal to 0.3048 m/s².

### History and Evolution
The concept of acceleration has been studied since the time of Galileo and Newton. The foot as a unit of measurement has its origins in ancient Rome, where it was based on the average length of a human foot. Over time, as scientific understanding evolved, the need for precise measurements in acceleration became apparent, leading to the adoption of ft/s² in various applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of foot per second squared, consider a car accelerating from rest to a speed of 60 ft/s in 3 seconds. The acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Change in Velocity}}{\text{Time}} \]

In this case:

\[ \text{Acceleration} = \frac{60 \text{ ft/s} - 0 \text{ ft/s}}{3 \text{ s}} = 20 \text{ ft/s}² \]

### Use of the Units
Foot per second squared is widely used in various applications, including:
- Automotive engineering to evaluate vehicle performance.
- Physics experiments to measure the effects of forces on objects.
- Safety assessments in transportation to ensure compliance with acceleration limits.
