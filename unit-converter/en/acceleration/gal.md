## Understanding the Gal (Galileo) Unit of Acceleration

### Definition
The gal (symbol: Gal) is a unit of acceleration defined as one centimeter per second squared (cm/s²). It is primarily used in geophysics and engineering to measure gravitational acceleration and other forms of acceleration. The gal is a convenient unit for expressing small accelerations, particularly in the context of Earth's gravitational field.

### Standardization
The gal is part of the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system of units, which is widely used in scientific disciplines. One gal is equivalent to 0.01 m/s², making it a useful conversion factor for those transitioning between different measurement systems. 

### History and Evolution
The term "gal" was introduced in the late 20th century, named after the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei, who made significant contributions to the study of motion and gravity. The adoption of the gal as a unit of measurement has facilitated more precise calculations in various scientific fields, particularly in geophysics, where it is essential for understanding gravitational variations.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the gal, consider an object in free fall under the influence of gravity. If the object accelerates at 980 cm/s², this can be expressed as 980 Gal. Conversely, if you want to convert this to meters per second squared, you would divide by 100, resulting in an acceleration of 9.8 m/s².

### Use of the Units
The gal is predominantly used in scientific research, engineering applications, and geophysical studies. It helps in measuring gravitational forces and understanding how different materials respond to acceleration.
