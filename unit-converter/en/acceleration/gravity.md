## Gravity Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
Gravity, denoted by the symbol **g**, is a fundamental physical quantity that measures the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface. It is a crucial parameter in physics and engineering, allowing users to understand how objects behave under the influence of gravitational force. The standard value of gravity is approximately **9.81 m/s²**.

### Standardization
Gravity is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) as meters per second squared (m/s²). This standardization ensures consistency in scientific calculations and engineering applications worldwide. Understanding gravity's value is essential for various fields, including physics, engineering, and environmental science.

### History and Evolution
The concept of gravity has evolved significantly over centuries. Sir Isaac Newton first formulated the law of universal gravitation in the 17th century, laying the groundwork for understanding gravitational forces. Later, Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity expanded our comprehension of gravity, describing it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass. This historical evolution highlights the importance of gravity in scientific inquiry and its relevance in modern applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the gravity unit converter, consider an example where you want to convert the gravitational acceleration from meters per second squared to kilometers per hour squared. 

1. **Input**: 9.81 m/s²
2. **Conversion**: 
   - 1 m/s² = 12960 km/h²
   - Therefore, 9.81 m/s² = 9.81 * 12960 = 127,116.8 km/h²
