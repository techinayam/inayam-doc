## Understanding Acceleration: The Meter per Second Squared Tool

### Definition
The meter per second squared (m/s²) is the standard unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI). It quantifies the rate of change of velocity of an object per unit time. For example, if an object accelerates at 1 m/s², its speed increases by 1 meter per second every second.

### Standardization
The meter per second squared is standardized by the SI system, ensuring consistency and accuracy in scientific calculations. This unit is widely used in physics and engineering to describe the acceleration of objects under the influence of forces, such as gravity or friction.

### History and Evolution
The concept of acceleration has been studied since the time of Galileo, who laid the groundwork for classical mechanics. The unit m/s² became standardized with the adoption of the metric system in the 18th century, allowing for a universal understanding of motion and forces.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how acceleration works, consider a car that increases its speed from 0 to 60 meters per second in 5 seconds. The acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Change in Velocity}}{\text{Time}} \]

Here, the change in velocity is 60 m/s, and the time is 5 seconds:

\[ \text{Acceleration} = \frac{60 \, \text{m/s} - 0 \, \text{m/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 12 \, \text{m/s}² \]

### Use of the Units
The meter per second squared is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and even everyday applications like calculating the acceleration of vehicles or the effects of gravity on falling objects. Understanding this unit helps in analyzing motion and predicting the behavior of objects under different forces.
