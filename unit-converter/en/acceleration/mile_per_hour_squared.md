## Understanding Mile Per Hour Squared (mi/h²)

### Definition
Mile per hour squared (mi/h²) is a unit of acceleration that quantifies the change in velocity of an object over time. Specifically, it measures how many miles per hour the speed of an object increases every hour. This unit is particularly useful in fields such as physics, engineering, and automotive industries, where understanding acceleration is crucial.

### Standardization
The mile per hour squared is part of the Imperial system of units, commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is derived from the basic unit of speed (miles per hour) and is standardized to ensure consistency in calculations across various applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring acceleration dates back to the early studies of motion by physicists like Galileo and Newton. The mile, as a unit of distance, has its roots in ancient Roman measurements, while the hour is a standard unit of time. Over the years, the use of mi/h² has evolved, becoming essential in automotive performance metrics and safety regulations.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the mile per hour squared, consider a car that accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3 seconds. The acceleration can be calculated as follows:

1. Convert the time from seconds to hours: 3 seconds = 0.000833 hours.
2. Calculate the acceleration: 
   \[
   \text{Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{60 \text{ mi/h}}{0.000833 \text{ h}} \approx 72000 \text{ mi/h}^2
   \]

### Use of the Units
Mile per hour squared is mainly used in automotive contexts, such as determining the acceleration capabilities of vehicles. It is also relevant in physics experiments and simulations where acceleration needs to be quantified in familiar units.
