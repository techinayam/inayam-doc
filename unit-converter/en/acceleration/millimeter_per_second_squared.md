## Millimeter per Second Squared (mm/s²) Tool Description

### Definition
Millimeter per second squared (mm/s²) is a unit of acceleration that measures the change in velocity per unit time. Specifically, it quantifies how much an object's speed increases or decreases in millimeters for every second that passes. This unit is particularly useful in various fields such as physics, engineering, and automotive industries, where precise measurements of acceleration are crucial.

### Standardization
The millimeter per second squared is part of the International System of Units (SI), where it is derived from the meter per second squared (m/s²). One millimeter per second squared is equal to 0.001 meters per second squared, allowing for easy conversions between these two units. This standardization ensures consistency in measurements across different applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of acceleration has been studied since the time of Galileo in the 16th century. The use of millimeters as a unit of measurement became popular in the 19th century, particularly in Europe. As scientific and engineering disciplines evolved, the need for precise measurements led to the adoption of mm/s² as a standard unit for acceleration, facilitating better communication and understanding among professionals.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the millimeter per second squared unit, consider a scenario where a car accelerates from rest to a speed of 60 km/h in 5 seconds. First, convert the speed to millimeters per second (60 km/h = 16,666.67 mm/s). The acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

\[ 
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Change in Velocity}}{\text{Time}} 
\]

\[ 
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{16,666.67 \text{ mm/s} - 0 \text{ mm/s}}{5 \text{ s}} = 3,333.33 \text{ mm/s}² 
\]

### Use of the Units
