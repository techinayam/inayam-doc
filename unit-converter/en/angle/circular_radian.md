## Circular Radian Converter Tool

### Definition
The circular radian (crad) is a unit of angular measurement that quantifies angles in terms of the radius of a circle. One circular radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of that circle. This unit is particularly useful in fields such as physics and engineering, where circular motion and wave phenomena are prevalent.

### Standardization
The circular radian is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized for use in scientific calculations. It is essential for ensuring consistency in measurements across various applications, making it a reliable choice for professionals and students alike.

### History and Evolution
The concept of radians dates back to ancient civilizations, but it was not until the 18th century that the radian was formally defined. The circular radian emerged as a natural choice for measuring angles, as it directly relates to the properties of circles. Over time, it has become a fundamental unit in mathematics, physics, and engineering, facilitating a deeper understanding of circular motion and trigonometric functions.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of circular radians, consider a circle with a radius of 5 meters. If an arc length of 5 meters is created, the angle in circular radians can be calculated as follows:

\[ 
\text{Angle (in crad)} = \frac{\text{Arc Length}}{\text{Radius}} = \frac{5 \text{ m}}{5 \text{ m}} = 1 \text{ crad} 
\]
