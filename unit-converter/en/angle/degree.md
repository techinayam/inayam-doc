## Degree Conversion Tool

### Definition
The degree (Â°) is a unit of measurement for angles, commonly used in geometry, trigonometry, and navigation. It represents 1/360th of a complete circle, making it a fundamental unit for various applications in mathematics and engineering.

### Standardization
Degrees are standardized in various fields, with the most common being the sexagesimal system, where a full rotation is divided into 360 degrees. This system is widely accepted globally, ensuring consistency in calculations and applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles in degrees dates back to ancient civilizations, including the Babylonians, who used a base-60 numbering system. The adoption of the degree as a unit of measurement has evolved over centuries, becoming a cornerstone in mathematics, astronomy, and navigation.

### Example Calculation
To convert an angle from degrees to radians, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]
For example, converting 90 degrees to radians:
\[ 90 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ radians} \]

### Use of the Units
Degrees are widely used in various fields, including:
- **Mathematics**: For calculating angles in geometric shapes.
- **Navigation**: To determine direction and bearings.
- **Engineering**: In designing and analyzing structures and systems.
- **Astronomy**: For measuring celestial angles.
