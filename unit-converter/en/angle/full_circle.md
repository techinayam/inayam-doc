## Full Circle (FC) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The Full Circle (FC) unit converter is an essential tool designed to convert angles measured in degrees to their equivalent in radians and vice versa. This tool is particularly useful for students, engineers, and professionals who frequently work with angular measurements in various fields such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.

### Standardization
In the realm of angular measurement, the standard unit is the radian, which is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle. The degree, on the other hand, is a more commonly used unit in everyday applications, where a full circle is divided into 360 degrees. The Full Circle unit converter adheres to these standard definitions, ensuring accurate and reliable conversions.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, with the Babylonians being credited for the division of the circle into 360 degrees. The radian was introduced later, providing a more natural way to relate angles to the properties of circles. Over time, the Full Circle unit converter has evolved to incorporate modern technology, making it easier for users to perform conversions quickly and accurately.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the functionality of the Full Circle unit converter, consider the following example: If you have an angle of 90 degrees and wish to convert it to radians, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \]

Thus, \( 90 \, \text{degrees} = 90 \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, \text{radians} \).

### Use of the Units
Understanding the conversion between degrees and radians is crucial in various applications, including trigonometry, calculus, and physics. The Full Circle unit converter allows users to seamlessly switch between these two units, enhancing their ability to solve problems involving angular measurements.
