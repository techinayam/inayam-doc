## Gradian (Gon) Converter Tool

### Definition
The gradian, also known as gon, is a unit of angular measurement that divides a right angle into 100 equal parts. This means that a full circle is 400 gradians. The gradian is particularly useful in fields such as surveying and engineering, where precise angle measurements are essential.

### Standardization
The gradian is standardized under the International System of Units (SI) and is recognized for its practical applications in various scientific and engineering disciplines. It provides a more intuitive way to measure angles, especially when working with decimal degrees.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the gradian dates back to the late 18th century, developed as a part of the metric system. The aim was to create a more straightforward method of measuring angles that would align with the decimal system. Over time, the gradian has gained popularity in specific fields, particularly in Europe, where it is often used in conjunction with other metric units.

### Example Calculation
To convert an angle from degrees to gradians, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Angle in Gon} = \text{Angle in Degrees} \times \frac{10}{9} \]
For example, to convert 90 degrees to gradians:
\[ 90 \times \frac{10}{9} = 100 \text{ gon} \]

### Use of the Units
Gradians are particularly beneficial in applications that require a high degree of precision, such as:
- Surveying and land measurement
- Engineering designs
- Navigation and mapping
- Geometry and trigonometry
