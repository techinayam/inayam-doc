## Half Circle (HC) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The half circle, represented by the symbol HC, is a fundamental unit in the measurement of angles. It denotes an angle of 180 degrees, which is half of a full circle (360 degrees). This unit is crucial in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and navigation, where precise angle measurements are essential.

### Standardization
The half circle is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) as part of the degree measurement system. While degrees are commonly used in everyday applications, radians are often preferred in scientific contexts. One half circle is equivalent to π radians, providing a seamless conversion between these two measurement systems.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, with the Babylonians being credited for the 360-degree circle system. The half circle has evolved as a critical component of this system, facilitating calculations in trigonometry and geometry. Over time, the half circle has found applications in diverse fields, from architecture to astronomy.

### Example Calculation
To convert an angle from degrees to half circles, you can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Half Circles (HC)} = \frac{\text{Degrees}}{180}
\]

For instance, if you have an angle of 90 degrees:

\[
\text{HC} = \frac{90}{180} = 0.5 \text{ HC}
\]

### Use of the Units
The half circle is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Mathematics**: In trigonometric functions and geometric calculations.
