## Millidegree (m°) Tool Description

### Definition
The millidegree (m°) is a unit of angular measurement that represents one-thousandth of a degree. It is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications where precise angle measurements are crucial. This unit allows for finer granularity in angle measurement, making it particularly useful in fields such as optics, navigation, and robotics.

### Standardization
The millidegree is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the degree, which is a standard unit for measuring angles. One degree is equal to 1,000 millidegrees, ensuring a straightforward conversion and standardization across various applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, where degrees were used to divide circles. The millidegree emerged in the 20th century as precision in engineering and science became increasingly important. As technology advanced, the need for finer measurements led to the adoption of the millidegree in various technical fields.

### Example Calculation
To convert degrees to millidegrees, simply multiply the degree value by 1,000. For example, if you have an angle of 2 degrees, the calculation would be:
\[ 
2 \text{ degrees} \times 1,000 = 2,000 \text{ millidegrees} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Millidegrees are particularly useful in applications requiring high precision, such as:
- Calibration of optical instruments
- Robotics and automation
- Aerospace engineering
- Geodesy and surveying
