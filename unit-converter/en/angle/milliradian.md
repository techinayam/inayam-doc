## Milliradian (mrad) Tool Description

### Definition
The milliradian (mrad) is a unit of angular measurement that is commonly used in various fields, including engineering, optics, and military applications. One milliradian is equal to one-thousandth of a radian, which is a standard unit of angular measure in the International System of Units (SI). This tool allows users to convert milliradians to other angular units, enhancing precision in calculations.

### Standardization
Milliradians are standardized within the metric system, making them a reliable choice for professionals who require accuracy in their measurements. The symbol for milliradian is "mrad," and it is widely recognized in scientific and technical literature.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the radian was introduced in the early 19th century, but the milliradian gained prominence in the 20th century, particularly in military and engineering contexts. Its adoption has enabled more precise calculations in fields such as ballistics and optics, where small angles can significantly impact outcomes.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the utility of the milliradian, consider a scenario where a shooter needs to adjust their aim based on the distance to a target. If the target is 1000 meters away and the shooter needs to adjust their aim by 1 mrad, the adjustment would be approximately 1 meter at that distance. This simple calculation demonstrates how even small angular changes can have substantial effects in practical applications.

### Use of the Units
Milliradians are particularly useful in applications that involve long distances and small angles. They are commonly used in:
- Military targeting and ballistics
- Optical systems and lenses
- Engineering calculations involving angles
