## Octant Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The octant is a unit of angular measurement that represents one-eighth of a full circle. It is equivalent to 45 degrees or Ï€/4 radians. The symbol for octant is "oct." This unit is particularly useful in various fields, including navigation, engineering, and geometry, where precise angle measurements are essential.

### Standardization
The octant is part of the broader system of angular measurement, which includes degrees, radians, and gradians. Standardization of angular units allows for consistent communication and calculation across different disciplines. The octant is widely recognized and utilized in both academic and practical applications, ensuring that calculations involving angles are accurate and universally understood.

### History and Evolution
The concept of dividing a circle into sections dates back to ancient civilizations. The octant has its roots in the early studies of geometry and navigation. Historically, mariners used octants to measure angles between celestial bodies and the horizon, aiding in navigation. Over time, the octant evolved into a standard unit of measurement, facilitating advancements in various scientific fields.

### Example Calculation
To convert degrees to octants, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Octants} = \frac{\text{Degrees}}{45} \]

For example, if you have an angle of 90 degrees, the conversion to octants would be:

\[ \text{Octants} = \frac{90}{45} = 2 \text{ octants} \]

### Use of the Units
The octant is commonly used in fields such as:

- **Navigation**: To determine angles between celestial bodies.
