## Quarter Circle (QC) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The quarter circle, denoted as QC, is a unit of angular measurement representing a 90-degree angle. It is a fundamental concept in geometry and trigonometry, often used in various fields such as engineering, architecture, and physics. Understanding the quarter circle is essential for accurate calculations involving angles, rotations, and circular motion.

### Standardization
The quarter circle is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) as part of the radian measurement system. One quarter circle is equivalent to π/2 radians, which is approximately 1.5708 radians. This standardization allows for consistency in calculations across different scientific and engineering disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the quarter circle dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was used in the study of geometry and astronomy. The Greeks, particularly Euclid, made significant contributions to the understanding of angles and their properties. Over the centuries, the quarter circle has evolved into a crucial element in modern mathematics and engineering, facilitating advancements in various technologies.

### Example Calculation
To convert a quarter circle into degrees, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Degrees} = \text{QC} \times 90 \]
For instance, if you have an angle of 1 quarter circle (QC), it equals:
\[ 1 \times 90 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

### Use of the Units
The quarter circle is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Engineering**: Designing structures that require precise angles.
- **Physics**: Analyzing rotational motion and forces.
- **Architecture**: Creating aesthetically pleasing designs with circular elements.
