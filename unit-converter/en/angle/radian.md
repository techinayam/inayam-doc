## Radian Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
A radian (symbol: rad) is a standard unit of angular measure used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. This makes radians a natural choice for measuring angles in relation to circular motion.

### Standardization
The radian is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely accepted in scientific and engineering applications. Unlike degrees, which divide a circle into 360 parts, radians provide a direct relationship between the angle and the radius, making calculations more straightforward in many mathematical contexts.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the radian dates back to the early 18th century, with significant contributions from mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler. Over time, the radian has become the preferred unit for angular measurement in calculus and trigonometry, largely due to its natural fit in mathematical formulas involving circular motion and periodic functions.

### Example Calculation
To convert an angle from degrees to radians, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{radians} = \frac{\text{degrees} \times \pi}{180} \]
For example, to convert 90 degrees to radians:
\[ \text{radians} = \frac{90 \times \pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ rad} \]

### Use of the Units
Radians are essential in various applications, including:
- Trigonometric calculations
- Physics problems involving rotational motion
- Engineering designs that require angular measurements
- Computer graphics and animations
