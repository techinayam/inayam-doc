## Small Angle Converter Tool

### Definition
The Small Angle Converter (symbol: SA) is a specialized tool designed to convert angles measured in small units, such as degrees, radians, and gradians. This tool is particularly useful for engineers, architects, and students who frequently work with angles in various applications, including construction, navigation, and physics.

### Standardization
Angles are standardized measurements that can be expressed in different units. The most common units include degrees (°), radians (rad), and gradians (gons). Understanding these units and their conversions is crucial for accurate calculations in fields that rely on precise angle measurements.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, where angles were often measured using simple tools and methods. Over time, the need for standardized measurements led to the development of various units. The small angle approximation, which simplifies calculations in physics and engineering, has further emphasized the importance of accurate angle conversion.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the Small Angle Converter, consider converting 30 degrees to radians. The formula for conversion is:
\[ \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]
Thus, 
\[ 30° \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians} \]

### Use of the Units
The Small Angle Converter is essential for various applications, including:
- Engineering designs that require precise angle measurements.
- Navigation systems that rely on accurate angle calculations.
- Physics problems involving trigonometric functions and small angle approximations.
