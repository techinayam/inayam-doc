## Third Circle (TC) Tool Description

### Definition
The Third Circle (TC) is a unit of measurement used in the field of angles, particularly in geometric and trigonometric calculations. It represents a division of a circle into three equal parts, where each part corresponds to 120 degrees. This tool is essential for anyone working with angular measurements, including architects, engineers, and mathematicians.

### Standardization
The Third Circle is standardized within the metric system, ensuring consistency and accuracy in calculations. It is part of a broader set of angular measurements that include degrees, radians, and gradians. By utilizing the TC tool, users can seamlessly convert between these units, enhancing their precision in various applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of dividing circles into equal parts dates back to ancient civilizations, where different cultures developed their own systems of measurement. The Third Circle emerged as a practical solution for simplifying complex calculations. Over the years, advancements in mathematics and technology have led to the creation of tools that facilitate easy conversions and calculations, such as our TC tool.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the Third Circle, consider a scenario where you need to convert 240 degrees into TC. Since one TC equals 120 degrees, you would divide 240 by 120, resulting in 2 TC. This simple calculation showcases the tool's utility in converting between degrees and TC.
