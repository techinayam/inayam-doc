## Three-Eighth Circle (TEC) Converter Tool

### Definition
The Three-Eighth Circle (TEC) is a unit of angular measurement that represents a specific fraction of a complete circle. In degrees, a three-eighth circle is equivalent to 135 degrees. This measurement is essential in various fields, including engineering, architecture, and design, where precise angles are crucial for accurate calculations and constructions.

### Standardization
The Three-Eighth Circle is standardized within the broader context of angular measurements, which include degrees, radians, and gradians. The conversion between these units is vital for professionals who need to switch between different measurement systems. The TEC is particularly useful in applications that require a clear understanding of angles in relation to circular motion or geometry.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, where the circle was divided into 360 degrees. The Three-Eighth Circle emerged as a practical unit for specific applications, particularly in fields that require precise angular measurements. Over time, the use of TEC has evolved, becoming a standard reference point in modern engineering and design practices.

### Example Calculation
To convert a Three-Eighth Circle to radians, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \]
For a Three-Eighth Circle:
\[ 135 \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \approx 2.356 \text{ radians} \]

### Use of the Units
The Three-Eighth Circle is commonly used in:
- Engineering designs where specific angles are required.
- Architectural plans that involve circular elements.
- Graphic design projects that necessitate precise angular measurements.
