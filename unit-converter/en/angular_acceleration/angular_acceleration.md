## Angular Acceleration Tool

### Definition
Angular acceleration is the rate at which the angular velocity of an object changes with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, typically measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²). This measurement is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and robotics, as it helps in understanding rotational motion and dynamics.

### Standardization
The standard unit of angular acceleration is the radian per second squared (rad/s²). Other common units include degrees per second squared (°/s²) and revolutions per minute squared (rev/min²). This standardization allows for consistent communication and calculations across different scientific and engineering disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has evolved significantly since the early days of classical mechanics. Pioneers like Galileo and Newton laid the groundwork for understanding motion, which eventually led to the formal definition of angular acceleration. Over time, advancements in technology and mathematics have refined our understanding, making it essential in modern applications such as robotics, aerospace, and automotive engineering.

### Example Calculation
To calculate angular acceleration, you can use the formula:
\[ \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} \]
Where:
- \( \alpha \) = angular acceleration (rad/s²)
- \( \Delta \omega \) = change in angular velocity (rad/s)
- \( \Delta t \) = change in time (s)

For example, if an object’s angular velocity changes from 10 rad/s to 20 rad/s in 5 seconds, the angular acceleration would be:
\[ \alpha = \frac{20 \, \text{rad/s} - 10 \, \text{rad/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 2 \, \text{rad/s²} \]
