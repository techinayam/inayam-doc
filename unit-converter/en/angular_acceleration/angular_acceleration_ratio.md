## Angular Acceleration Ratio Tool

### Definition
Angular acceleration is defined as the rate of change of angular velocity over time. It is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s²). This tool allows users to convert and calculate angular acceleration, providing a straightforward way to understand rotational motion dynamics.

### Standardization
The standard unit for angular acceleration is radians per second squared (rad/s²). This unit is widely accepted in physics and engineering, ensuring consistency across various applications, from mechanical systems to aerospace engineering.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has evolved significantly since the early studies of motion. Initially, scientists like Galileo and Newton laid the groundwork for understanding rotational dynamics. Over the years, advancements in technology and mathematics have refined our understanding, leading to the standardized measurement of angular acceleration we use today.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the angular acceleration ratio tool, consider a scenario where a wheel increases its angular velocity from 10 rad/s to 20 rad/s in 5 seconds. The angular acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Angular Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{20 \, \text{rad/s} - 10 \, \text{rad/s}}{5 \, \text{s}} = 2 \, \text{rad/s²} \]

Using our tool, you can easily convert this value into other units or calculate further scenarios.
