## Radian per Hour Squared (rad/h²) Tool Description

### Definition
The radian per hour squared (rad/h²) is a unit of angular acceleration that quantifies the change in angular velocity over time. Specifically, it measures how quickly an object’s rotational speed is increasing or decreasing, making it essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and robotics.

### Standardization
Radian is the standard unit of angular measurement in the International System of Units (SI). Angular acceleration, expressed in rad/h², is derived from the fundamental relationship between angular displacement and time. This unit allows for precise calculations and comparisons in various applications, ensuring consistency across scientific and engineering disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has been around since the early studies of motion. The radian itself was introduced in the 18th century, and its use as a standard unit has evolved alongside advancements in mathematics and physics. The rad/h² unit has become increasingly relevant with the rise of modern technologies, particularly in the fields of robotics and aerospace engineering.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of radian per hour squared, consider an object that starts from rest and reaches an angular velocity of 10 rad/h in 2 hours. The angular acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Angular Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{10 \text{ rad/h} - 0 \text{ rad/h}}{2 \text{ h}} = 5 \text{ rad/h}² \]

### Use of the Units
Radian per hour squared is particularly useful in applications involving rotational dynamics, such as calculating the performance of motors, analyzing the motion of celestial bodies, or designing mechanical systems. Understanding angular acceleration is crucial for engineers and scientists who work with rotating systems.
