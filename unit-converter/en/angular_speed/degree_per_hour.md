## Degree Per Hour (°/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The degree per hour (°/h) is a unit of angular speed that measures the angle in degrees that an object rotates in one hour. This unit is essential in various fields, including physics, engineering, and navigation, where understanding the rate of rotation is crucial.

### Standardization
The degree is a standard unit of angular measurement, with a full circle comprising 360 degrees. The degree per hour is widely accepted for measuring angular velocity in various applications, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication across disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, with the Babylonians being among the first to divide the circle into 360 degrees. The degree per hour emerged as a practical unit for expressing angular speed, particularly in the fields of astronomy and navigation, where precise measurements are vital.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of degrees per hour, consider a scenario where a wheel rotates 180 degrees in 2 hours. The angular speed can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Angular Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Degrees}}{\text{Total Time in Hours}} = \frac{180°}{2 \text{ hours}} = 90°/h \]

### Use of the Units
Degrees per hour is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Astronomy:** Tracking the movement of celestial bodies.
- **Engineering:** Designing rotating machinery and systems.
- **Navigation:** Calculating the course of ships and aircraft.
