## Understanding Degree per Minute (°/min)

### Definition
Degree per minute (°/min) is a unit of angular speed that measures the angle in degrees traversed in one minute. It is commonly used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and navigation, where understanding rotational motion is essential. 

### Standardization
The degree is a standard unit of angular measurement, with a full rotation equating to 360 degrees. The minute, in this context, refers to a time period of 60 seconds. Thus, degree per minute provides a clear and standardized way to express how quickly an object is rotating.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angles dates back to ancient civilizations, where the degree was used to divide circles. The minute as a time measurement evolved from the division of hours into smaller parts. Over time, the combination of these units into degree per minute has become essential for various applications, including astronomy and engineering.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of degree per minute, consider a wheel that completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 2 minutes. The angular speed can be calculated as follows:
- Angular Speed = Total Degrees / Time in Minutes
- Angular Speed = 360° / 2 min = 180°/min

### Use of the Units
Degree per minute is particularly useful in fields such as:
- **Mechanical Engineering**: For analyzing the speed of rotating machinery.
- **Aerospace**: To determine the angular velocity of aircraft.
- **Navigation**: For calculating the course changes in maritime and aerial navigation.
