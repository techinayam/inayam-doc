## Degrees Per Hour Squared Tool Description

### Definition
The **degrees per hour squared (°/h²)** is a unit of angular acceleration that measures the rate of change of angular velocity over time. It quantifies how quickly an object is accelerating in its rotational motion, making it essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and robotics.

### Standardization
Degrees per hour squared is part of the metric system but is often used in conjunction with other angular measurements. While the SI unit for angular acceleration is radians per second squared (rad/s²), degrees per hour squared provides a more intuitive understanding for applications involving slower rotational movements.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has evolved over centuries, with early studies in mechanics laying the groundwork for modern physics. The use of degrees as a measure of angles dates back to ancient civilizations, and the integration of time into this measurement has led to the adoption of degrees per hour squared in various scientific and engineering contexts.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of degrees per hour squared, consider a wheel that increases its rotational speed from 0°/h to 100°/h in 2 hours. The angular acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Angular Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta \text{Angular Velocity}}{\Delta \text{Time}} = \frac{100°/h - 0°/h}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50°/h²
\]

### Use of the Units
Degrees per hour squared is commonly used in applications involving machinery, vehicles, and any system where rotational motion is a factor. It helps engineers and scientists analyze the performance and safety of rotating components.
