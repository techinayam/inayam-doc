## Gradians per Second (grad/s) Tool Description

### Definition
Gradians per second (grad/s) is a unit of angular speed that measures the rate of rotation in gradians. A gradian, also known as a gon or grade, is a unit of angular measurement where a complete circle is divided into 400 gradians. This makes it particularly useful in fields such as surveying and engineering, where precision in angular measurements is crucial.

### Standardization
The gradian is part of the metric system and is standardized by the International System of Units (SI). While degrees and radians are more commonly used in various applications, the gradian provides a unique perspective, especially in calculations involving right angles, as it simplifies the conversion between angles and distances.

### History and Evolution
The concept of gradians originated in the 18th century as mathematicians sought a more systematic approach to angular measurement. The gradian was developed to facilitate calculations in trigonometry and geometry, particularly in fields requiring high precision. Over time, its use has expanded into various engineering disciplines, making it a valuable tool for professionals.

### Example Calculation
To convert an angular speed of 90 degrees per second to gradians per second, you can use the following formula:
\[ 
\text{Angular Speed (grad/s)} = \text{Angular Speed (degrees/s)} \times \frac{10}{9} 
\]
So, for 90 degrees per second:
\[ 
90 \, \text{degrees/s} \times \frac{10}{9} = 100 \, \text{grad/s} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Gradians per second is commonly used in fields like navigation, robotics, and physics, where understanding the rate of rotation is essential. It allows for easier calculations when dealing with angles, especially in systems that utilize a 400-point circle.
