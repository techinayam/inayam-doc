## Radian per Hour (rad/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The radian per hour (rad/h) is a unit of angular speed that measures the angle in radians that an object rotates in one hour. Angular speed is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and robotics, where understanding the rate of rotation is essential for accurate calculations and predictions.

### Standardization
The radian is the standard unit of angular measure in the International System of Units (SI). One complete revolution corresponds to \(2\pi\) radians, making it a fundamental unit in trigonometry and calculus. The use of rad/h allows for a consistent method of expressing angular velocity over time.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular measurement dates back to ancient civilizations, but the formalization of the radian as a unit occurred in the 18th century. The radian per hour emerged as a practical unit for measuring rotational speed, especially in applications involving machinery and celestial navigation.

### Example Calculation
To convert angular speed from degrees per hour to radians per hour, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Angular Speed (rad/h)} = \text{Angular Speed (degrees/h)} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \]

For instance, if an object rotates at 360 degrees per hour:
\[ 360 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = 2\pi \text{ rad/h} \]

### Use of the Units
Radian per hour is widely used in various applications such as:
- Robotics, to determine the speed of rotating joints.
- Astronomy, to calculate the angular velocity of celestial bodies.
- Mechanical engineering, to analyze the performance of rotating machinery.
