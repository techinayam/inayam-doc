## Radians Per Hour Squared (rad/h²) Tool Description

### Definition
Radians per hour squared (rad/h²) is a unit of angular acceleration that measures how quickly an object's angular velocity changes over time. It is particularly useful in fields such as physics, engineering, and robotics, where understanding rotational motion is crucial.

### Standardization
The radian is the standard unit of angular measurement in the International System of Units (SI). One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle. Radians per hour squared is derived from this standardization, providing a clear and consistent way to express angular acceleration.

### History and Evolution
The concept of angular acceleration has evolved significantly since the early studies of motion by ancient philosophers. The use of radians as a unit of angular measurement became prominent in the 18th century, with mathematicians like Leonhard Euler contributing to its formalization. Over time, the application of radians per hour squared has expanded into various scientific and engineering disciplines, reflecting the growing complexity of rotational dynamics.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of radians per hour squared, consider an object that accelerates from an angular velocity of 0 rad/h to 10 rad/h in 2 hours. The angular acceleration can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Angular Acceleration} = \frac{\Delta \text{Angular Velocity}}{\Delta \text{Time}} = \frac{10 \, \text{rad/h} - 0 \, \text{rad/h}}{2 \, \text{h}} = 5 \, \text{rad/h}^2
\]

### Use of the Units
Radians per hour squared is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Robotics, for controlling the motion of robotic arms.
- Aerospace engineering, for analyzing the rotational dynamics of spacecraft.
- Mechanical engineering, for designing systems involving rotating machinery.
