## Revolution Per Hour Tool Overview

### Definition
Revolution per hour (rev/h) is a unit of angular speed that quantifies the number of complete revolutions an object makes in one hour. This measurement is essential in various fields such as engineering, physics, and mechanics, where understanding rotational motion is crucial.

### Standardization
The revolution per hour is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) as part of angular measurements. While it is not an SI unit itself, it is commonly used alongside SI units for practical applications. The equivalent SI unit for angular velocity is radians per second (rad/s), which can be converted from rev/h for more precise calculations.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring rotational speed dates back to early mechanical inventions, where understanding the speed of gears and wheels was vital. Over time, as technology advanced, the need for standardized measurements like rev/h became essential in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of revolution per hour, consider a wheel that completes 150 revolutions in one hour. The angular speed can be expressed as:
- **Angular Speed = 150 rev/h**

### Use of the Units
Revolution per hour is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Automotive Engineering:** To measure the rotational speed of engines and wheels.
