## Rolls Per Second (rps) Tool Description

### Definition
Rolls per second (rps) is a unit of angular speed that measures the number of complete rotations or rolls an object makes in one second. This metric is particularly useful in various fields such as mechanical engineering, robotics, and physics, where understanding the rotational speed of objects is crucial.

### Standardization
The rolls per second unit is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) framework, allowing for consistent measurements across different applications. It is essential to understand that rps can be converted to other angular speed units such as revolutions per minute (rpm) or radians per second, depending on the context of the application.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring angular speed has evolved significantly since the early days of mechanics. Historically, units like rpm were predominantly used; however, with advancements in technology and the need for more precise measurements, rps has gained prominence. This evolution reflects the growing importance of angular speed in modern engineering and technology.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate rolls per second, consider a wheel that completes 5 full rotations in 2 seconds. The calculation would be as follows:

\[ 
\text{rps} = \frac{\text{Number of Rolls}}{\text{Time in Seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ rolls}}{2 \text{ seconds}} = 2.5 \text{ rps} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Rolls per second is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Robotics: To determine the speed of robotic arms and wheels.
- Automotive: To measure the rotational speed of tires.
- Manufacturing: In conveyor systems where items roll from one point to another.
