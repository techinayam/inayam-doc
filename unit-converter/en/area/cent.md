### History and Evolution
The term "cent" is derived from the Latin word "centum," meaning one hundred. Historically, the cent was used to represent one-hundredth of an acre, which has evolved into its current usage in land measurement. Over the years, the cent has become a standard unit in several countries, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.

### Example Calculation
To convert cent to square meters, you can use the following formula:
1 cent = 40.47 square meters

For instance, if you have a plot of land measuring 5 cents, the area in square meters would be:
5 cents × 40.47 m²/cent = 202.35 m²
