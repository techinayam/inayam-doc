### Definition
The square foot (symbol: ft²) is a unit of area measurement commonly used in the United States and Canada. It represents the area of a square with sides measuring one foot in length. This unit is particularly useful for real estate, construction, and interior design, where space is often measured in square feet.

### Standardization
The square foot is part of the Imperial system of measurement, which is widely used in various applications, including architecture and land measurement. One square foot is equivalent to 144 square inches or approximately 0.092903 square meters in the metric system.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring area dates back to ancient civilizations, where land was measured in various units. The square foot emerged as a standard unit in the 19th century, gaining popularity in North America. Its usage has persisted due to its practicality in everyday applications, particularly in real estate and construction.

### Example Calculation
To convert square feet to square meters, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Area in m²} = \text{Area in ft²} \times 0.092903 \]
For instance, if you have an area of 500 square feet, the conversion to square meters would be:
\[ 500 \, \text{ft²} \times 0.092903 = 46.4515 \, \text{m²} \]
