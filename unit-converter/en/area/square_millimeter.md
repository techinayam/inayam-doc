## Tool Description: Square Millimeter (mm²) Converter

The Square Millimeter (mm²) is a unit of area measurement commonly used in various fields, including engineering, architecture, and manufacturing. This tool allows users to convert square millimeters to other area units, providing a seamless experience for those needing precise area calculations.

### Definition
A square millimeter (mm²) is defined as the area of a square with sides measuring one millimeter in length. It is a metric unit of area that is widely utilized in scientific and technical applications.

### Standardization
The square millimeter is part of the International System of Units (SI). It is standardized and recognized globally, ensuring consistency in measurements across different regions and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of area measurement has evolved over centuries, with the metric system being established in the late 18th century. The square millimeter emerged as a practical unit for small-scale measurements, especially in fields that require high precision, such as electronics and material science.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the square millimeter, consider a square with a side length of 10 mm. The area can be calculated as follows:
\[ 
\text{Area} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 10 \, \text{mm} \times 10 \, \text{mm} = 100 \, \text{mm}² 
\]
