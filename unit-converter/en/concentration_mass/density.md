## Density Converter Tool

### Definition
Density is a fundamental physical property of matter defined as mass per unit volume. It is expressed in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). Understanding density is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and environmental science, as it helps in determining how substances interact with one another.

### Standardization
The standard unit of density in the International System of Units (SI) is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). This standardization allows for consistency in scientific communication and calculations across different disciplines and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been around since ancient times, with Archimedes being one of the first to study it extensively. Over the centuries, advancements in measurement techniques and scientific understanding have refined our knowledge of density, leading to its current definition and applications in various fields.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the density of a substance, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]

For example, if you have a mass of 500 kg and a volume of 2 m³, the density would be:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{500 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ m³}} = 250 \text{ kg/m³} \]

### Use of the Units
Density is used in numerous applications, such as determining buoyancy in fluids, calculating material properties in engineering, and analyzing environmental impacts. It is also essential in converting between different units of mass and volume, making it a valuable tool for scientists, engineers, and students alike.
