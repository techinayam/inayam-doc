## Tool Description: Gram per Cubic Meter (g/m³) Converter

The **Gram per Cubic Meter (g/m³)** is a unit of measurement that expresses the concentration of a substance in terms of mass per unit volume. This tool is essential for scientists, engineers, and anyone involved in fields that require precise measurements of material density. Whether you're working with liquids, gases, or solids, understanding the concentration of materials in g/m³ can significantly impact your calculations and outcomes.

### Definition

Gram per cubic meter (g/m³) is defined as the mass of a substance in grams contained in one cubic meter of volume. It is a standard unit used in various scientific and industrial applications to measure the density of materials.

### Standardization

The gram per cubic meter is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements to ensure consistency across various fields. This unit is derived from the base SI units: the gram (g) for mass and the cubic meter (m³) for volume.

### History and Evolution

The concept of measuring density dates back to ancient civilizations, but the formalization of units like the gram and cubic meter evolved over centuries. The metric system, which includes g/m³, was established in France in the late 18th century and has since been adopted globally for scientific and commercial use.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the gram per cubic meter converter, consider the following example:

If you have a substance with a mass of 500 grams and it occupies a volume of 2 cubic meters, the concentration in g/m³ can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Concentration (g/m³)} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Volume (m³)}} = \frac{500 \text{ g}}{2 \text{ m³}} = 250 \text{ g/m³} \]

### Use of the Units

The g/m³ unit is widely used in various fields, including:

- Environmental science for measuring air and water quality.
- Chemistry for calculating concentrations of solutions.
- Engineering for assessing material properties.
