## Grams per Cubic Centimeter (g/cm³) Tool Description

### Definition
Grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in grams divided by its volume in cubic centimeters. This measurement is crucial in various scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering, as it helps in understanding the properties of materials.

### Standardization
The gram per cubic centimeter is part of the metric system, which is standardized globally. It is commonly used in scientific research and industry to ensure consistency in measurements. The unit is particularly important in fields such as material science and fluid dynamics, where precise density measurements are essential.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density dates back to ancient civilizations, but the formal definition of grams per cubic centimeter emerged with the development of the metric system in the late 18th century. Over the years, as scientific understanding and measurement techniques improved, the use of g/cm³ became widespread in laboratories and industrial applications.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the density of a substance, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Density (g/cm³)} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Volume (cm³)}} \]

For instance, if you have a substance with a mass of 200 grams and a volume of 50 cubic centimeters, the density would be:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{50 \text{ cm³}} = 4 \text{ g/cm³} \]

### Use of the Units
Grams per cubic centimeter is widely used to determine the density of solids and liquids. It is particularly useful in applications such as material selection, quality control, and in various calculations involving buoyancy and fluid dynamics.
