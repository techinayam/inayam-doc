## Grams per Decimeter Cube (g/dm³) Tool Description

### Definition
Grams per decimeter cube (g/dm³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in grams contained within one decimeter cube (1 dm³). This measurement is crucial in various scientific fields, including chemistry and physics, as it helps in understanding the concentration of solutions and the properties of materials.

### Standardization
The unit g/dm³ is part of the metric system, which is standardized globally. It is commonly used in scientific research and industry to ensure consistency and accuracy in measurements. The relationship between grams per decimeter cube and other density units, such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³) or grams per liter (g/L), is straightforward, allowing for easy conversions.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, but the metric system, which includes g/dm³, was developed in France during the late 18th century. The adoption of the metric system has allowed for a more uniform approach to measurements, facilitating advancements in science and technology.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of grams per decimeter cube, consider a solution with a mass of 200 grams contained in a volume of 2 dm³. The density can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{200 \, \text{g}}{2 \, \text{dm}^3} = 100 \, \text{g/dm}^3 \]

### Use of the Units
Grams per decimeter cube is widely used in various applications, including:
- Determining the concentration of solutions in chemistry.
- Calculating the density of materials in engineering and manufacturing.
- Assessing the properties of food and beverages in the food industry.
