## Kilogram per Cubic Meter (kg/m³) Tool Description

### Definition
The kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in kilograms contained within one cubic meter of volume. This measurement is crucial in various scientific and engineering applications, allowing for the comparison of densities across different materials.

### Standardization
The kilogram per cubic meter is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely accepted in scientific literature and industry standards. It is essential for ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various fields, including physics, chemistry, and engineering.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, but the formalization of units like kg/m³ emerged with the development of the metric system in the late 18th century. The kilogram was defined as the mass of a specific physical object, while the cubic meter was established as a standard volume measurement. Over time, the kg/m³ unit has become integral in fields such as material science, fluid dynamics, and environmental studies.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of kg/m³, consider a substance with a mass of 500 kilograms occupying a volume of 2 cubic meters. The density can be calculated as follows:

Density (kg/m³) = Mass (kg) / Volume (m³)  
Density = 500 kg / 2 m³ = 250 kg/m³

### Use of the Units
The kilogram per cubic meter is used extensively in various applications, including:
- Determining the density of liquids and gases.
- Calculating buoyancy in fluid mechanics.
- Assessing material properties in construction and manufacturing.
- Environmental studies, such as analyzing pollutant concentrations.
