## Mass Percentage Tool Description

### Definition
The mass percentage, represented by the symbol "%", is a way to express the concentration of a substance in a mixture. It is calculated by taking the mass of the solute and dividing it by the total mass of the solution, then multiplying by 100. This measurement is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science, as it allows for a clear understanding of the proportion of a component in a mixture.

### Standardization
Mass percentage is standardized across scientific disciplines, ensuring that it is universally understood and applied. This consistency allows researchers and professionals to communicate effectively and compare results across different studies and applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of mass percentage has evolved over time, originating from the need to quantify concentrations in chemical solutions. As scientific research advanced, the mass percentage became a fundamental metric in analytical chemistry, enabling precise calculations and formulations in laboratories and industrial processes.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate mass percentage, consider a solution containing 10 grams of salt dissolved in 90 grams of water. The total mass of the solution is 100 grams. The mass percentage of salt in the solution is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Mass Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Solute}}{\text{Total Mass of Solution}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Mass Percentage} = \left( \frac{10g}{100g} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

### Use of the Units
Mass percentage is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Chemistry**: To prepare solutions with specific concentrations.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: To ensure accurate dosages in medications.
- **Food Science**: To analyze nutritional content and ingredient proportions.
- **Environmental Science**: To assess pollutant concentrations in samples.
