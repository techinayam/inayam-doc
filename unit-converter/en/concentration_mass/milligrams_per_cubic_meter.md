## Milligrams per Cubic Meter (mg/m³) Tool Description

### Definition
Milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m³) is a unit of measurement used to express the concentration of a substance in the air or other gases. It quantifies how many milligrams of a particular substance are present in one cubic meter of air, making it a crucial metric in fields such as environmental science, occupational health, and air quality monitoring.

### Standardization
The milligram per cubic meter is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in scientific and industrial applications. It is essential for standardizing measurements across various disciplines, ensuring consistency and accuracy when assessing air quality and pollutant levels.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring air quality dates back to the early 20th century when scientists began to recognize the impact of air pollutants on human health and the environment. Over time, the milligram per cubic meter became a standard unit for reporting concentrations of airborne substances, allowing for better regulatory frameworks and public awareness.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the concentration of a substance in mg/m³, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Concentration (mg/m³)} = \frac{\text{Mass of substance (mg)}}{\text{Volume of air (m³)}} \]

For instance, if you have 50 mg of a pollutant in 10 m³ of air, the concentration would be:

\[ \text{Concentration} = \frac{50 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ m³}} = 5 \text{ mg/m³} \]

### Use of the Units
Milligrams per cubic meter is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Environmental monitoring to assess air quality.
- Occupational safety to ensure safe working conditions.
- Research in atmospheric science to study pollutant dispersion.
