## Grams per Cubic Centimeter (g/cm³) Tool Description

### Definition
Grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in grams contained within a volume of one cubic centimeter. This measurement is crucial in various scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering, as it helps determine how heavy a material is relative to its size.

### Standardization
The unit grams per cubic centimeter is part of the metric system and is widely accepted in scientific literature. It is standardized in accordance with the International System of Units (SI), where density is defined as mass divided by volume. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across different applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, with Archimedes being one of the first to explore the relationship between mass and volume. The metric system, established in the late 18th century, introduced standardized units like grams and cubic centimeters, facilitating easier communication and calculation in scientific endeavors. Over the years, g/cm³ has become a fundamental unit in various industries, including material science and pharmaceuticals.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the grams per cubic centimeter tool, consider a substance with a mass of 50 grams occupying a volume of 10 cubic centimeters. The density can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Density (g/cm³)} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Volume (cm³)}} = \frac{50 \text{ g}}{10 \text{ cm³}} = 5 \text{ g/cm³} \]

### Use of the Units
Grams per cubic centimeter is commonly used to express the density of liquids and solids. It is particularly useful in fields such as chemistry for calculating concentrations, in engineering for material selection, and in environmental science for assessing pollutant concentrations in water.
