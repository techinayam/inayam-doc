## Grams per Milliliter (g/mL) Tool Description

### Definition
Grams per milliliter (g/mL) is a unit of measurement that expresses the concentration of a substance in a solution. It indicates how many grams of a solute are present in one milliliter of solution. This metric is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, where precise measurements are essential for experiments and formulations.

### Standardization
The grams per milliliter unit is standardized internationally, ensuring consistency across scientific research and applications. It is widely accepted in laboratories and industries, making it a reliable metric for measuring concentration.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring concentration dates back to the early days of chemistry. As scientific methods evolved, so did the need for precise measurements. The grams per milliliter unit became a standard in the 19th century, allowing scientists to communicate their findings effectively and replicate experiments with accuracy.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the grams per milliliter unit, consider a solution containing 10 grams of salt dissolved in 100 milliliters of water. The concentration can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Concentration (g/mL)} = \frac{\text{Mass of solute (g)}}{\text{Volume of solution (mL)}} \]

\[ \text{Concentration} = \frac{10 \text{ g}}{100 \text{ mL}} = 0.1 \text{ g/mL} \]

### Use of the Units
Grams per milliliter is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Preparing chemical solutions in laboratories.
- Formulating pharmaceuticals and medications.
- Analyzing the density of liquids in industrial processes.
