## Molarity Tool Description

### Definition
Molarity, denoted by the symbol **M**, is a unit of concentration that expresses the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. It is a fundamental concept in chemistry, particularly in the fields of analytical chemistry and solution chemistry, where precise measurements are crucial for experiments and reactions.

### Standardization
Molarity is standardized as moles of solute divided by liters of solution. This unit allows chemists to prepare solutions with exact concentrations, ensuring consistency and accuracy in chemical reactions. The formula for calculating molarity is:

\[ \text{Molarity (M)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}} \]

### History and Evolution
The concept of molarity was introduced in the early 20th century as a means to facilitate the understanding of chemical reactions in solutions. Over the years, it has become a cornerstone in the field of chemistry, allowing for the standardization of solutions and enabling chemists to communicate concentrations effectively.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the molarity of a solution, you can use the following example:

Suppose you dissolve 0.5 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) in 2 liters of water. The molarity (M) of the solution would be:

\[ M = \frac{0.5 \text{ moles}}{2 \text{ liters}} = 0.25 \text{ M} \]

### Use of the Units
Molarity is widely used in various applications, including:
- Preparing chemical solutions for laboratory experiments.
- Performing titrations to determine the concentration of unknown solutions.
- Calculating the stoichiometry of chemical reactions.
