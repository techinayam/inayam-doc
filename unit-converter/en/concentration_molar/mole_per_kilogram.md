## Mole per Kilogram (mol/kg) Tool Description

### Definition
Mole per kilogram (mol/kg) is a unit of measurement that expresses the concentration of a substance in a solution. It quantifies the number of moles of solute present in one kilogram of solvent. This metric is crucial in various scientific fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science, as it allows researchers and professionals to accurately assess the concentration of solutions.

### Standardization
The mole is a fundamental unit in the International System of Units (SI), defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. The mole per kilogram standardizes concentration measurements, making it easier to compare and replicate results across different experiments and studies.

### History and Evolution
The concept of molarity dates back to the early 20th century when chemists sought a standardized way to express concentrations. The mole was introduced as a fundamental unit in 1971, and since then, mol/kg has become a standard unit for expressing concentration in scientific literature and laboratory practices.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the mole per kilogram unit, consider a solution containing 0.5 moles of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved in 1 kilogram of water. The concentration of the solution can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Moles of solute}}{\text{Mass of solvent (kg)}} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{mol}}{1 \, \text{kg}} = 0.5 \, \text{mol/kg} \]

### Use of the Units
Mole per kilogram is widely used in chemistry for preparing solutions, conducting titrations, and performing stoichiometric calculations. It is also essential in pharmacology for determining drug concentrations in biological systems and in environmental science for assessing pollutant concentrations in water and soil.

### Usage Guide
To use the mole per kilogram conversion tool effectively, follow these steps:
1. **Input the Amount**: Enter the number of moles of the solute you wish to convert.
