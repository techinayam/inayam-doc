## Gigabyte (GB) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
A gigabyte (GB) is a unit of digital information storage that is commonly used in computing and telecommunications. It is equivalent to 1,073,741,824 bytes or 1,024 megabytes (MB). The gigabyte is a standard measurement for data storage capacity, making it essential for understanding file sizes, memory capacities, and data transfer rates.

### Standardization
The gigabyte is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in both binary and decimal systems. In the binary system, 1 GB equals 2^30 bytes, while in the decimal system, it is defined as 10^9 bytes. This duality can lead to confusion, so it’s important to clarify which system is being used when discussing data sizes.

### History and Evolution
The term "gigabyte" was first introduced in the 1980s as computers began to require larger storage capacities. Over the years, as technology advanced, the need for more precise measurements became apparent, leading to the establishment of standards by organizations like the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This evolution has made the gigabyte a fundamental unit in the digital age.

### Example Calculation
To convert gigabytes to megabytes, you can use the following formula:
1 GB = 1,024 MB

For example, if you have 5 GB of data, it can be calculated as:
5 GB × 1,024 MB/GB = 5,120 MB

### Use of the Units
Gigabytes are commonly used to measure the storage capacity of hard drives, SSDs, USB flash drives, and memory cards. Additionally, they are used to quantify data transfer limits in internet plans and to describe the size of files such as videos, images, and software applications.
