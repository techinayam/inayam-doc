## Kilobyte (KB) Converter Tool

### Definition
A kilobyte (KB) is a unit of digital information storage that is commonly used to quantify data size. In the binary system, one kilobyte is equivalent to 1,024 bytes. This measurement is essential for understanding file sizes, memory capacity, and data transfer rates in computing.

### Standardization
The kilobyte is part of the International System of Units (SI), and it is often used in conjunction with other data storage units such as megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB). While the binary definition (1 KB = 1,024 bytes) is widely accepted, some contexts may use the decimal definition (1 KB = 1,000 bytes) for simplicity, particularly in marketing and consumer electronics.

### History and Evolution
The term "kilobyte" originated in the early days of computing, when memory was limited and data storage was a critical concern. As technology evolved, the need for standardized units became apparent, leading to the adoption of the kilobyte as a fundamental unit of measurement. Over the years, the kilobyte has remained relevant, even as storage capacities have increased exponentially.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the concept of kilobytes, consider a text file that is 5,120 bytes in size. To convert this to kilobytes, you would divide by 1,024:
\[ 
\text{Size in KB} = \frac{5,120 \text{ bytes}}{1,024} = 5 \text{ KB} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Kilobytes are commonly used to measure the size of small files, such as text documents, images, and audio files. Understanding kilobytes is crucial for managing data storage effectively, especially for users dealing with limited storage capacities.
