## Megabyte (MB) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
A megabyte (MB) is a unit of digital information storage that is commonly used to quantify data size. It is equivalent to 1,024 kilobytes (KB) or 1,048,576 bytes. The megabyte is a standard measurement in computing, often used to describe the size of files, memory capacity, and data transfer rates.

### Standardization
The megabyte is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in both binary (1 MB = 1,024 KB) and decimal (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes) contexts. While the binary definition is prevalent in computing, the decimal definition is often used in data storage marketing.

### History and Evolution
The term "megabyte" was first introduced in the 1970s as computers began to handle larger amounts of data. Over the years, as technology advanced, the need for standardized units became crucial for both hardware manufacturers and software developers. The evolution of data storage has seen the megabyte transition from a theoretical concept to a practical measurement used in everyday computing.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion of megabytes to bytes, consider a file size of 5 MB. To convert this to bytes, you would multiply by 1,048,576 (the number of bytes in a megabyte):
\[ 5 \text{ MB} \times 1,048,576 \text{ bytes/MB} = 5,242,880 \text{ bytes} \]

### Use of the Units
Megabytes are commonly used in various contexts, including:
- File sizes (e.g., documents, images, videos)
- Memory capacity (e.g., RAM, storage devices)
- Data transfer rates (e.g., internet speed)
