## Tebibyte (TiB) Converter Tool

### Definition
A tebibyte (TiB) is a unit of digital information storage that equals 2^40 bytes, or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. It is part of the binary measurement system, which is commonly used in computing and data storage. The tebibyte is particularly useful for measuring large amounts of data, such as hard drive capacities and data transfer rates.

### Standardization
The tebibyte is standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as part of the binary prefix system. This system was established to provide clarity and precision in data measurement, distinguishing between binary and decimal interpretations of data sizes. The use of the tebibyte helps avoid confusion with the terabyte (TB), which is based on powers of ten (1 TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes).

### History and Evolution
The term "tebibyte" was introduced in 2005 as part of the IEC's binary prefix standard. As data storage needs grew, so did the necessity for more precise measurements. The tebibyte emerged to address the discrepancies between binary and decimal systems, ensuring that users could accurately assess their data storage requirements.

### Example Calculation
To convert from tebibytes to gigabytes (GB), you can use the following formula:
1 TiB = 1,024 GiB (gibibytes) = 1,048,576 MB (megabytes).

For example, if you have 2 TiB of data:
2 TiB = 2 x 1,024 GiB = 2,048 GiB.

### Use of the Units
Tebibytes are commonly used in various fields, including IT, data science, and digital media. They are particularly relevant for measuring:
- Hard drive capacities
- Cloud storage solutions
- Data transfer rates in network systems
