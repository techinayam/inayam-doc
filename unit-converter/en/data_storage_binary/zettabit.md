## Zettabit (Zb) Converter Tool

### Definition
A zettabit (Zb) is a unit of digital information storage that represents 2^70 bits, or 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 bits. As the digital landscape continues to expand, understanding data storage units like the zettabit becomes increasingly important for both individuals and organizations. This tool allows users to convert zettabits to other data storage units, facilitating a better grasp of data sizes in various contexts.

### Standardization
The zettabit is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized for use in computing and telecommunications. It is essential for professionals in data science, IT, and telecommunications to understand these units to communicate effectively about data storage and transfer capacities.

### History and Evolution
The term "zettabit" emerged from the need to quantify the growing amounts of digital data. As technology advanced, the need for larger units of measurement became apparent, leading to the introduction of the zettabit alongside other units like kilobits, megabits, gigabits, and terabits. The evolution of data storage has seen exponential growth, with zettabits representing a significant milestone in this progression.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the utility of the zettabit, consider a scenario where you have 1 zettabit of data. If you want to convert this to gigabits, you would use the following calculation:

1 Zb = 1,073,741,824 Gb (gigabits)
