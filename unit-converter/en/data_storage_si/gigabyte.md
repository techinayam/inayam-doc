## Gigabyte (GB) Converter Tool

### Definition
A gigabyte (GB) is a unit of digital information storage that is commonly used to quantify data size in computing and telecommunications. One gigabyte is equivalent to 1,073,741,824 bytes or 1,024 megabytes (MB). This unit is essential for understanding storage capacities of devices such as hard drives, USB flash drives, and memory cards.

### Standardization
The gigabyte is standardized by the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in both binary and decimal contexts. While the binary definition (1 GB = 2^30 bytes) is often used in computing, the decimal definition (1 GB = 10^9 bytes) is more common in data storage marketing. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurate data management.

### History and Evolution
The term "gigabyte" was first introduced in the 1980s as a way to describe large data storage capacities. As technology advanced, the need for larger storage units became apparent, leading to the adoption of the gigabyte as a standard measurement. Over the years, the gigabyte has evolved alongside advancements in technology, paving the way for even larger units such as terabytes (TB) and petabytes (PB).

### Example Calculation
To convert 5 gigabytes to megabytes, you can use the following calculation:
5 GB Ã— 1,024 MB/GB = 5,120 MB

### Use of the Units
Gigabytes are widely used in various applications, including:
- Measuring the storage capacity of hard drives and SSDs.
- Determining the size of software applications and games.
- Assessing data usage for internet plans and mobile devices.
