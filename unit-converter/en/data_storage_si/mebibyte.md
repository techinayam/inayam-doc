## Mebibyte (MiB) Tool Description

### Definition
A mebibyte (MiB) is a unit of digital information storage that is equal to 1,048,576 bytes, or 2^20 bytes. It is commonly used in computing to represent memory and storage capacities. Unlike the megabyte (MB), which is based on the decimal system (1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes), the mebibyte is based on binary, making it a more precise measurement for computer memory.

### Standardization
The term "mebibyte" was standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1998 to address the confusion between binary and decimal interpretations of data sizes. The IEC established a set of binary prefixes, including mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), and tebi (Ti), to provide clarity in data measurement.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring data storage has evolved significantly since the early days of computing. Initially, data sizes were often expressed in terms of kilobytes (KB) and megabytes (MB). However, as technology advanced and storage capacities grew, the need for more precise measurements became apparent. The introduction of the mebibyte helped eliminate ambiguity and provided a standardized way to quantify data storage.

### Example Calculation
To convert mebibytes to bytes, simply multiply the number of mebibytes by 1,048,576. For example, if you have 5 MiB of data:
5 MiB Ã— 1,048,576 bytes/MiB = 5,242,880 bytes.

### Use of the Units
Mebibytes are widely used in various computing contexts, including:
- Measuring RAM and cache memory in computers.
- Specifying file sizes in software applications.
- Representing storage capacities in hard drives and SSDs.
