## Gigabyte per Hour (GB/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The gigabyte per hour (GB/h) is a unit of measurement used to quantify data transfer speeds. It indicates the amount of data, measured in gigabytes, that can be transmitted or processed in one hour. This metric is particularly useful in fields such as data communications, networking, and cloud computing, where understanding data transfer rates is crucial for performance evaluation.

### Standardization
The gigabyte is defined as 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30 bytes) in the binary system, which is commonly used in computing. However, in some contexts, a gigabyte may also be considered as 1,000,000,000 bytes (10^9 bytes) in the decimal system. The standardization of GB/h allows for consistent communication of data transfer speeds across various platforms and technologies.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring data transfer speeds has evolved alongside advancements in technology. Initially, data transfer was measured in bits per second (bps), but as data sizes grew, larger units like kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes became necessary. The introduction of the gigabyte per hour metric has allowed users to better understand and manage data transfer rates, especially in high-bandwidth applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate data transfer speed in gigabytes per hour, consider a scenario where a file of 10 gigabytes is downloaded in 2 hours. The calculation would be:

\[ \text{Speed (GB/h)} = \frac{\text{Total Data (GB)}}{\text{Time (h)}} \]

\[ \text{Speed (GB/h)} = \frac{10 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ h}} = 5 \text{ GB/h} \]

### Use of the Units
The gigabyte per hour unit is widely used in various applications, including:
- Evaluating internet connection speeds.
- Assessing cloud storage and data transfer capabilities.
- Monitoring data usage in network management.
