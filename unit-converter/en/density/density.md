## Density Tool: Your Comprehensive Guide

### Definition
Density is a fundamental physical property of matter defined as mass per unit volume. It is typically expressed in units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³) or grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). Understanding density is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and material science, as it helps in identifying substances and predicting their behavior under different conditions.

### Standardization
The standard unit for measuring density in the International System of Units (SI) is the kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m³). Other common units include grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) and tonnes per cubic meter (t/m³). The versatility of density measurements allows for conversions between various units, making it easier for professionals and students alike to work with different materials and contexts.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been explored since ancient times, with Archimedes famously using it to determine the purity of gold. Over the centuries, advancements in measurement techniques and scientific understanding have refined how density is calculated and applied. Today, density plays a critical role in fields such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and material science.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the density of a substance, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]

For instance, if you have a substance with a mass of 200 grams and a volume of 100 cubic centimeters, the density would be:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{100 \text{ cm}^3} = 2 \text{ g/cm}^3 \]

### Use of the Units
Density is utilized in various applications, such as:
- Identifying materials based on their density.
- Calculating buoyancy in fluids.
- Assessing the quality and purity of substances.
- Designing materials for specific applications in engineering and construction.
