## Understanding Gram per Cubic Centimeter (g/cm³)

### Definition
Gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in grams contained within a volume of one cubic centimeter. This measurement is crucial in various scientific fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering, as it helps determine the material's properties and behavior under different conditions.

### Standardization
The gram per cubic centimeter is part of the metric system and is standardized internationally. It is commonly used in scientific literature and industry to ensure consistent communication of density values across various applications. 

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, with Archimedes famously discovering principles related to buoyancy. The metric system was established in the late 18th century, and the gram per cubic centimeter became a standard unit for measuring density, particularly in laboratory settings. Over the years, advancements in technology have allowed for more precise measurements, making the g/cm³ a reliable unit in both academic and industrial contexts.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate density using the gram per cubic centimeter, consider a scenario where you have a substance with a mass of 200 grams and a volume of 50 cubic centimeters. The density can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]

\[ \text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{50 \text{ cm}³} = 4 \text{ g/cm}³ \]

### Use of the Units
The gram per cubic centimeter is widely used in various fields, including:
- **Chemistry**: To determine the density of liquids and solids.
- **Material Science**: To assess the properties of materials.
- **Environmental Science**: To analyze soil and water density.
- **Food Industry**: To measure the density of various food products.
