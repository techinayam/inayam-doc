## Understanding Gram per Cubic Meter (g/m³)

### Definition
Gram per cubic meter (g/m³) is a unit of density that expresses the mass of a substance in grams contained within one cubic meter of volume. This metric is crucial in various scientific and engineering fields, allowing for the comparison of densities of different materials.

### Standardization
The gram per cubic meter is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in scientific literature and industry standards. It provides a consistent method for measuring density, making it easier to communicate and compare results across different disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, but the formalization of units like the gram per cubic meter emerged with the development of the metric system in the late 18th century. The SI unit system was established in 1960, further standardizing measurements and facilitating international collaboration in science and industry.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the density of an object, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Density (g/m³)} = \frac{\text{Mass (g)}}{\text{Volume (m³)}} \]

For instance, if you have a substance with a mass of 500 grams and a volume of 0.5 cubic meters, the density would be:
\[ \text{Density} = \frac{500 \text{ g}}{0.5 \text{ m³}} = 1000 \text{ g/m³} \]

### Use of the Units
Gram per cubic meter is commonly used in fields such as chemistry, physics, and engineering. It is particularly useful for comparing the densities of gases, liquids, and solids, aiding in material selection and quality control processes.
