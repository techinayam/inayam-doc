## Kilogram per Cubic Meter (kg/m³) Tool Description

### Definition
The kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m³) is a unit of density that expresses mass per unit volume. This metric is essential in various scientific and engineering fields, providing a standardized way to measure how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance. Understanding density is crucial for applications ranging from material science to fluid dynamics.

### Standardization
The kilogram per cubic meter is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements across scientific disciplines. This unit allows for consistent communication of density values, facilitating collaboration and research across various fields.

### History and Evolution
The concept of density has been studied since ancient times, but the formalization of units like kg/m³ emerged with the development of the metric system in the late 18th century. The SI unit kg/m³ became widely adopted in the 20th century, providing a universal standard for density measurement.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the density of a substance, use the formula:
\[ \text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \]
For example, if you have a mass of 200 kg and a volume of 0.5 m³, the density would be:
\[ \text{Density} = \frac{200 \text{ kg}}{0.5 \text{ m}³} = 400 \text{ kg/m}³ \]

### Use of the Units
Kilogram per cubic meter is widely used in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and environmental science. It helps in determining material properties, assessing buoyancy in fluids, and calculating load-bearing capacities.
