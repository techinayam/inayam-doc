## Ampere-Hour (Ah) Converter Tool

### Definition
The ampere-hour (Ah) is a unit of electric charge that represents the amount of electric charge transferred by a steady current of one ampere flowing for one hour. It is commonly used to measure the capacity of batteries, indicating how long a battery can deliver a certain current before it is depleted. Understanding ampere-hours is crucial for anyone working with electrical systems, whether in automotive, electronics, or renewable energy sectors.

### Standardization
The ampere-hour is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the ampere, which is the base unit of electric current. The standardization of the ampere-hour allows for consistent measurements across various applications, ensuring that users can accurately gauge battery capacity and performance.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electric charge dates back to the early 19th century with the development of the first batteries. Over time, as electrical technology advanced, the ampere-hour became a standard measurement for battery capacity. This evolution has allowed for better design and efficiency in electrical systems, making it easier for users to select the right batteries for their needs.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate ampere-hours, consider a battery that discharges at a current of 2 amperes for 5 hours. The total charge in ampere-hours can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Ampere-Hours (Ah)} = \text{Current (A)} \times \text{Time (h)} \]

\[ \text{Ah} = 2 \, \text{A} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 10 \, \text{Ah} \]

This means the battery has a capacity of 10 ampere-hours.

### Use of the Units
Ampere-hours are widely used in various applications, including:
- **Batteries**: To determine how long a battery can power a device.
