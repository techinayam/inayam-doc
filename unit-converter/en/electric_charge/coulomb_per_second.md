## Tool Description: Coulomb per Second (C/s) Converter

The **Coulomb per Second (C/s)** is a unit of electric current, representing the flow of electric charge. It is a fundamental measurement in the field of electrical engineering and physics, allowing users to quantify the rate at which electric charge is transferred through a conductor. This tool is essential for anyone working with electrical systems, whether in academic research, engineering projects, or practical applications.

### Definition

The **Coulomb per Second (C/s)** is defined as the amount of electric charge (in coulombs) that passes through a given point in a circuit per second. This unit is equivalent to the **Ampere (A)**, which is the standard unit of electric current in the International System of Units (SI).

### Standardization

The Coulomb is a standardized unit of electric charge, defined as the quantity of charge transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second. The relationship between coulombs and amperes is foundational in electrical theory, ensuring consistency across various applications and calculations.

### History and Evolution

The concept of electric charge dates back to the late 18th century with the pioneering work of scientists like Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, after whom the unit is named. The development of the ampere as a unit of current was formalized in the 19th century, leading to the widespread adoption of the C/s as a practical measurement in electrical engineering.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate the use of the Coulomb per Second, consider a circuit where a current of 2 A flows. The amount of charge passing through a point in the circuit in one second can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Charge (C)} = \text{Current (A)} \times \text{Time (s)} \]

For 2 A over 1 second:

\[ \text{Charge} = 2 \, \text{A} \times 1 \, \text{s} = 2 \, \text{C} \]

### Use of the Units

The Coulomb per Second is widely used in various fields, including:

- Electrical engineering for designing circuits and systems.
- Physics for studying electric fields and forces.
- Telecommunications for analyzing signal transmission.
