## Electric Charge Converter Tool

### Definition
Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. The standard unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C), represented by the symbol âš¡. This tool allows users to convert between various units of electric charge, including millicoulombs, microcoulombs, and faradays, among others.

### Standardization
The coulomb is defined as the amount of electric charge transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second. This standardization is crucial for scientific calculations and ensures consistency across various applications in physics and engineering.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric charge dates back to the early experiments with static electricity in the 18th century. Pioneers like Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, after whom the unit is named, laid the groundwork for our understanding of electrostatics. Over the years, the study of electric charge has evolved, leading to the development of various units and measurement techniques that are now standardized in the International System of Units (SI).

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the Electric Charge Converter, consider converting 5 coulombs into millicoulombs. Since 1 coulomb equals 1,000 millicoulombs, the calculation would be:

\[ 
5 \, \text{C} \times 1000 = 5000 \, \text{mC} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Understanding electric charge is essential in various fields, including electronics, physics, and electrical engineering. The units of charge are used to quantify the amount of electricity flowing in circuits, assess battery capacities, and analyze electrochemical reactions.
