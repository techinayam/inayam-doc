## Kilocoulomb per Hour (kC/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The kilocoulomb per hour (kC/h) is a unit of electric charge flow, representing the amount of electric charge (in kilocoulombs) that passes through a conductor in one hour. This unit is particularly useful in electrical engineering and physics, where understanding the flow of electric charge is crucial for designing and analyzing circuits.

### Standardization
The kilocoulomb is derived from the coulomb, which is the standard unit of electric charge in the International System of Units (SI). One kilocoulomb equals 1,000 coulombs. The standardization of this unit allows for consistent measurements across various scientific and engineering applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric charge dates back to the early studies of electricity in the 18th century. The coulomb was named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, a French physicist who made significant contributions to electrostatics. Over time, as electrical engineering evolved, the need for larger units like the kilocoulomb became apparent, especially in high-voltage applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of kilocoulomb per hour, consider a scenario where an electric circuit allows a charge of 5 kC to flow in one hour. This can be expressed as:
- Charge Flow = 5 kC/h
This means that in one hour, 5,000 coulombs of charge have passed through the circuit.

### Use of the Units
Kilocoulomb per hour is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Electrical engineering for circuit design.
- Analyzing battery discharge rates.
- Understanding the flow of electric charge in capacitors and inductors.
