## Megaampere-Hour (MAh) Converter Tool

### Definition
The megaampere-hour (MAh) is a unit of electric charge that represents one million ampere-hours. It is commonly used in the field of electrical engineering and battery technology to quantify the total charge capacity of batteries and other electrical storage systems. Understanding this unit is essential for professionals and enthusiasts working with large-scale electrical systems.

### Standardization
The megaampere-hour is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the ampere, which is the base unit of electric current. One MAh is equivalent to 3.6 billion coulombs, as it is calculated by multiplying the current (in amperes) by the time (in hours) that the current flows.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electric charge dates back to the early discoveries of electricity in the 18th century. As technology advanced, the need for standardized measurements became crucial, leading to the establishment of the ampere as a base unit in the late 19th century. The megaampere-hour emerged as a practical unit for measuring large quantities of electric charge, especially in industrial applications and energy storage systems.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the megaampere-hour, consider a scenario where a battery discharges at a current of 2 MAh for 5 hours. The total charge delivered can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Charge (MAh)} = \text{Current (MA)} \times \text{Time (h)} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 2 \, \text{MA} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 10 \, \text{MAh} \]

### Use of the Units
The megaampere-hour is particularly useful in applications such as:
- Electric vehicle battery capacity assessment
- Large-scale energy storage systems
- Industrial power supply management
- Renewable energy systems, such as solar and wind
