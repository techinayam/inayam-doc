## Ampere-Hour (Ah) Converter Tool

### Definition
The ampere-hour (Ah) is a unit of electric charge that represents the amount of electric charge transferred by a steady current of one ampere flowing for one hour. It is commonly used to measure the capacity of batteries, indicating how long a battery can deliver a specific current before it is depleted.

### Standardization
The ampere-hour is standardized under the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the ampere, which is the base unit of electric current. The relationship between ampere-hours and coulombs (the SI unit of electric charge) is defined as:
1 Ah = 3600 coulombs.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electric charge dates back to the early days of electricity. The ampere-hour was introduced as a practical way to quantify battery capacity, allowing users to understand how long a battery can power a device. Over the years, advancements in battery technology have made the ampere-hour a crucial metric in various applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate ampere-hours, consider a battery that supplies a current of 2 amperes for 5 hours. The total charge in ampere-hours can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Charge (Ah)} = \text{Current (A)} \times \text{Time (h)} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge (Ah)} = 2 \, \text{A} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 10 \, \text{Ah} \]

### Use of the Units
The ampere-hour is widely used in various fields, including:
- **Consumer Electronics:** To determine battery life in smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
- **Electric Vehicles:** To assess the range and efficiency of electric car batteries.
- **Renewable Energy:** In solar energy systems to evaluate battery storage capacity.
