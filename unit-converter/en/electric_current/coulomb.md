## Coulomb (C) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The coulomb (symbol: C) is the standard unit of electric charge in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the amount of electric charge transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second. Understanding the coulomb is essential for anyone working in the field of electrical engineering, physics, or related disciplines, as it provides a fundamental measure of electrical phenomena.

### Standardization
The coulomb is standardized by the International System of Units (SI), ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various scientific and engineering applications. This standardization is crucial for effective communication and collaboration among professionals in the field, as it allows for uniformity in calculations and data reporting.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric charge has evolved significantly since the 18th century. The term "coulomb" was named after the French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who conducted pioneering work on electrostatics. His experiments laid the groundwork for the understanding of electric forces and charges, leading to the formal adoption of the coulomb as a unit of measurement in the late 19th century.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the coulomb, consider a circuit with a current of 2 amperes flowing for 3 seconds. The total charge (Q) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ Q = I \times t \]

Where:
- \( Q \) is the charge in coulombs (C)
- \( I \) is the current in amperes (A)
- \( t \) is the time in seconds (s)

Substituting the values:

\[ Q = 2 \, A \times 3 \, s = 6 \, C \]

Thus, the total charge transferred is 6 coulombs.

### Use of the Units
Coulombs are widely used in various applications, including:
- Electrical engineering for designing circuits and systems.
- Physics for studying electric fields and forces.
- Telecommunications for understanding signal transmission and reception.
