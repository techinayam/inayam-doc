## Electric Current Converter Tool

### Definition
Electric current is the flow of electric charge, typically measured in amperes (A). It represents the rate at which charge is transferred through a conductor. Understanding electric current is crucial for various applications in electronics, physics, and engineering.

### Standardization
The standard unit of electric current is the ampere, symbolized as "A." The International System of Units (SI) defines the ampere based on the force between two parallel conductors carrying electric current. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across different applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric current dates back to the 19th century when scientists like André-Marie Ampère laid the groundwork for understanding electricity. Over the years, the measurement of electric current has evolved with advancements in technology, leading to the development of various units such as milliampere (mA), kiloampere (kA), and megaampere (MA). These units allow for a more precise understanding of current in different contexts, from small electronic devices to large power systems.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion between units, consider a scenario where you have a current of 2 amperes. To convert this to milliampere, you would use the following calculation:

\[ 
\text{Current in mA} = \text{Current in A} \times 1000 
\]

So, 

\[ 
2 \, \text{A} = 2 \times 1000 = 2000 \, \text{mA} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Electric current units are essential in various fields, including:
- **Electronics:** Understanding the current flowing through circuits.
