## Megaohm (MΩ) Converter Tool

### Definition
The megaohm (MΩ) is a unit of electrical resistance that is equal to one million ohms (1,000,000 Ω). It is commonly used in electrical engineering and physics to measure the resistance of materials and components in electrical circuits. Understanding resistance is crucial for designing and analyzing electrical systems, ensuring safety, and optimizing performance.

### Standardization
The megaohm is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the ohm, which is the standard unit of resistance. The symbol for megaohm is MΩ, and it is widely recognized in scientific literature and engineering practices. The use of megaohms allows for easier representation of large resistance values, making calculations and comparisons more manageable.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance was first introduced by Georg Simon Ohm in the 1820s, leading to the formulation of Ohm's Law. As electrical technology advanced, the need to measure higher resistance values became apparent, resulting in the adoption of the megaohm as a standard unit. Over the years, the megaohm has played a vital role in the development of electrical systems, from early telegraph lines to modern electronic devices.

### Example Calculation
To convert resistance values from ohms to megaohms, simply divide the value in ohms by 1,000,000. For example, if you have a resistance of 5,000,000 ohms, the conversion to megaohms would be:

\[ 
5,000,000 \, \text{Ω} \div 1,000,000 = 5 \, \text{MΩ} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Megaohms are particularly useful in applications involving high resistance measurements, such as insulation testing, circuit design, and troubleshooting. They help engineers and technicians assess the quality and safety of electrical components, ensuring that systems operate efficiently and without risk of failure.
