## Milliohm (mΩ) Converter Tool

### Definition
The milliohm (mΩ) is a unit of electrical resistance in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to one-thousandth of an ohm (Ω), which is the standard unit for measuring electrical resistance. Understanding milliohms is crucial for professionals in electrical engineering, electronics, and related fields, as it allows for precise measurements in low-resistance applications.

### Standardization
The milliohm is standardized under the SI unit system, ensuring consistency and reliability in electrical measurements. It is commonly used in various applications, including electrical circuits, power systems, and electronic devices, where low resistance values are prevalent.

### History and Evolution
The concept of resistance was first introduced by Georg Simon Ohm in the 1820s, leading to the formulation of Ohm's Law. As technology advanced, the need for more precise measurements in low-resistance scenarios emerged, giving rise to the milliohm as a practical unit. Over the years, the milliohm has become essential in fields such as telecommunications, automotive engineering, and renewable energy systems.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of milliohms, consider a scenario where a circuit has a total resistance of 0.005 Ω. To convert this to milliohms, simply multiply by 1,000:
\[ 
0.005 \, \text{Ω} \times 1000 = 5 \, \text{mΩ} 
\]
This conversion is vital for engineers who need to work with low resistance values accurately.

### Use of the Units
Milliohms are particularly useful in applications such as:
- Measuring the resistance of wires and cables.
