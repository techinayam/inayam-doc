## Volt per Ohm (V/Ω) Tool Description

### Definition
The volt per ohm (V/Ω) is a derived unit of electric current, representing the flow of electric charge in relation to the resistance in an electrical circuit. This unit is crucial for understanding Ohm's Law, which states that current (I) is equal to voltage (V) divided by resistance (R). Therefore, V/Ω is equivalent to amperes (A), making it a vital unit in electrical engineering and physics.

### Standardization
The volt per ohm is standardized within the International System of Units (SI), where:
- 1 V/Ω = 1 A (Ampere)
This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in electrical measurements across various applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric current has evolved significantly since the 19th century, with pioneers like Georg Simon Ohm and André-Marie Ampère laying the groundwork for our understanding of electricity. The volt, named after Alessandro Volta, and the ohm, named after Georg Simon Ohm, have become fundamental units in electrical science. The relationship between these units has been pivotal in developing modern electrical systems and technologies.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the volt per ohm, consider a circuit with a voltage of 12 volts and a resistance of 4 ohms. Using Ohm's Law:
\[ I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12V}{4Ω} = 3A \]
Thus, the current flowing through the circuit is 3 amperes, which can also be expressed as 3 V/Ω.

### Use of the Units
The volt per ohm is primarily used in electrical engineering, physics, and various applications involving electrical circuits. It helps engineers and technicians calculate current flow, design circuits, and troubleshoot electrical issues.
