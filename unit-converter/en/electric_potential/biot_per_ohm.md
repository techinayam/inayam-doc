## Biot per Ohm (Bi/Ω) Converter Tool

### Definition
The Biot per Ohm (Bi/Ω) is a derived unit of electric potential that quantifies the relationship between electric current and resistance in a circuit. It is essential for understanding how voltage, current, and resistance interact within electrical systems. This unit is particularly useful in fields such as electrical engineering and physics, where precise calculations are critical.

### Standardization
The Biot per Ohm is standardized within the International System of Units (SI), ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various applications. This standardization allows engineers and scientists to communicate their findings and calculations effectively, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric potential has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. The Biot per Ohm derives its name from Jean-Baptiste Biot, a French physicist known for his work in electromagnetism. Over the years, the unit has been refined and standardized to meet the needs of modern technology and scientific research, making it an essential tool for professionals in the industry.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the Biot per Ohm, consider a simple circuit with a current of 2 amperes flowing through a resistor of 4 ohms. The electric potential (V) can be calculated using Ohm's Law:

\[ V = I \times R \]

Where:
- \( V \) = electric potential in volts (V)
- \( I \) = current in amperes (A)
- \( R \) = resistance in ohms (Ω)

Substituting the values:

\[ V = 2 \, \text{A} \times 4 \, \text{Ω} = 8 \, \text{V} \]

This calculation demonstrates how the Biot per Ohm can be utilized to determine electric potential in a circuit.

### Use of the Units
