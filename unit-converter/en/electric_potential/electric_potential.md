## Electric Potential Tool Description

The **Electric Potential** tool is an essential resource for anyone needing to convert between various units of electric potential, such as volts, millivolts, kilovolts, and more. This tool is designed to provide accurate and efficient conversions, making it invaluable for engineers, students, and professionals in the electrical field. 

### Definition

Electric potential, measured in volts (V), represents the potential energy per unit charge in an electric field. It is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, indicating how much work is needed to move a charge from one point to another against an electric field.

### Standardization

The International System of Units (SI) standardizes electric potential in volts. Other units like millivolts (mV), kilovolts (kV), and megavolts (MV) are derived from this base unit, allowing for versatile applications across various scales.

### History and Evolution

The concept of electric potential has evolved significantly since the early studies of electricity. Pioneers like Alessandro Volta, after whom the volt is named, laid the groundwork for understanding electric potential. Over the years, advancements in technology and scientific understanding have refined how we measure and utilize electric potential in practical applications.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the Electric Potential tool, consider the following example: If you have a voltage of 1000 volts and want to convert it to kilovolts, simply input "1000" in the volts field and select "kilovolts" as your desired output unit. The tool will provide the result of 1 kV.

### Use of the Units

Understanding the various units of electric potential is crucial for applications in electrical engineering, physics, and electronics. For instance, while working with microelectronics, millivolts may be more relevant, whereas kilovolts are commonly used in high-voltage applications.
