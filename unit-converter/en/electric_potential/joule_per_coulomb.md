## Joule per Coulomb (J/C) Converter Tool

### Definition
The joule per coulomb (J/C) is a derived unit of electric potential, also known as voltage. It quantifies the amount of energy (in joules) per unit charge (in coulombs) and is crucial in understanding electric circuits and systems. Essentially, it indicates how much energy is available to move electric charges through a circuit.

### Standardization
The joule per coulomb is standardized in the International System of Units (SI). In this system, one joule is defined as the energy transferred when a force of one newton is applied over a distance of one meter. One coulomb is defined as the quantity of electric charge transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in electrical measurements across various applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric potential has evolved significantly since the early studies of electricity. Pioneers like Alessandro Volta and Michael Faraday laid the groundwork for understanding electric charge and energy. The term "volt," which is the SI unit of electric potential, was named in honor of Volta. The joule per coulomb emerged as a practical way to express electric potential, bridging the gap between energy and charge in electrical engineering and physics.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of joules per coulomb, consider a simple circuit where a battery provides a voltage of 12 V (volts). If a charge of 2 C (coulombs) flows through the circuit, the energy transferred can be calculated as follows:

Energy (in joules) = Voltage (in volts) × Charge (in coulombs)  
Energy = 12 V × 2 C = 24 J

This means that 24 joules of energy are available to move the 2 coulombs of charge through the circuit.

### Use of the Units
The joule per coulomb is widely used in electrical engineering, physics, and various applications involving electric circuits. It helps in determining how much energy is available for electrical work, making it essential for designing circuits, analyzing power systems, and understanding energy consumption in devices.
