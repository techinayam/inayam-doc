## Millivolt (mV) Converter Tool

### Definition
The millivolt (mV) is a unit of electric potential equal to one-thousandth of a volt (V). It is commonly used in various electrical and electronic applications, particularly in measuring small voltages in circuits, sensors, and other devices. Understanding millivolts is essential for engineers, technicians, and hobbyists working with low-voltage systems.

### Standardization
The millivolt is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized under the volt. The symbol for millivolt is "mV," and it is widely recognized in scientific literature and industry standards. 

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric potential was first introduced in the 18th century, with the volt being named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta. The millivolt emerged as a practical unit for measuring small voltages, especially as technology advanced and the need for precision in electronic devices grew. Today, millivolts are integral to modern electrical engineering, particularly in fields such as telecommunications, instrumentation, and biomedical applications.

### Example Calculation
To convert volts to millivolts, simply multiply the voltage value by 1,000. For example, if you have a voltage of 0.5 volts, the conversion to millivolts would be:
\[ 
0.5 \, \text{V} \times 1000 = 500 \, \text{mV} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Millivolts are commonly used in various applications, including:
- Measuring the output of sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure)
- Testing batteries and power supplies
- Analyzing signals in electronic circuits
- Monitoring biomedical signals (e.g., ECG, EEG)
