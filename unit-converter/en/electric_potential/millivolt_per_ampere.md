## Millivolt per Ampere (mV/A) Converter Tool

### Definition
Millivolt per Ampere (mV/A) is a unit of measurement that expresses electric potential difference (voltage) per unit of current (amperage). This unit is crucial in various electrical engineering applications, particularly in analyzing the performance of electrical circuits and components. Understanding the relationship between voltage and current is essential for optimizing electrical systems.

### Standardization
The millivolt per ampere is derived from the International System of Units (SI), where:
- 1 millivolt (mV) = 0.001 volts (V)
- 1 ampere (A) is the base unit of electric current.

This standardization ensures that measurements are consistent across different applications and industries, facilitating accurate calculations and comparisons.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electrical potential and current has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. The introduction of Ohm's Law in the 19th century laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Over time, the millivolt per ampere unit has become increasingly relevant in modern electronics, particularly in fields such as telecommunications, automotive engineering, and renewable energy systems.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of millivolt per ampere, consider a scenario where a circuit has a voltage of 5 mV and a current of 2 A. The calculation would be as follows:
\[ 
\text{mV/A} = \frac{\text{Voltage (mV)}}{\text{Current (A)}} = \frac{5 \text{ mV}}{2 \text{ A}} = 2.5 \text{ mV/A} 
\]
This calculation helps engineers and technicians assess the performance of the circuit.

### Use of the Units
Millivolt per ampere is commonly used in:
- Electrical circuit analysis
- Sensor calibration
- Power supply design
- Performance testing of electronic components
