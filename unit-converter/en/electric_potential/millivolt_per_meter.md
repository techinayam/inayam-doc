## Millivolt per Meter (mV/m) Tool Description

### Definition
Millivolt per meter (mV/m) is a unit of electric potential gradient, representing the change in electric potential per unit distance. It is commonly used in various fields, including electrical engineering and physics, to measure the strength of electric fields. Understanding this unit is essential for engineers and scientists working with electromagnetic fields and electrical systems.

### Standardization
The millivolt per meter is derived from the International System of Units (SI). One millivolt (mV) is equal to one-thousandth of a volt (V), and the meter (m) is the standard unit of length in the SI system. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across different applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric potential and its measurement has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. The introduction of the volt as a unit of electric potential was established in the 19th century, and the millivolt emerged as a practical subunit for measuring smaller electric potentials. Over time, the use of millivolt per meter has become crucial in various scientific and engineering applications, particularly in the study of electric fields.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of millivolt per meter, consider an electric field with a potential difference of 50 millivolts across a distance of 10 meters. The electric field strength can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Electric Field (E)} = \frac{\text{Potential Difference (V)}}{\text{Distance (d)}} \]

\[ E = \frac{50 \, \text{mV}}{10 \, \text{m}} = 5 \, \text{mV/m} \]

### Use of the Units
Millivolt per meter is widely used in various applications, including:
- Measuring electric fields in laboratory settings.
- Assessing electromagnetic interference in electronic devices.
- Evaluating the safety of electrical installations.
- Researching the effects of electric fields on biological systems.
