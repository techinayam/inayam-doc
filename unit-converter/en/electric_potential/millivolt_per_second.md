## Millivolt per Second (mV/s) Converter Tool

### Definition
Millivolt per second (mV/s) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the rate of change of electric potential. It is commonly used in electrical engineering and physics to describe how quickly voltage changes over time. Understanding this unit is essential for professionals working with circuits, sensors, and various electronic devices.

### Standardization
The millivolt per second is a derived unit in the International System of Units (SI). One millivolt (mV) is equal to one-thousandth of a volt (V). Therefore, when measuring in millivolts per second, it is crucial to remember that this unit is standardized against the volt, ensuring consistency across various applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electric potential dates back to the early studies of electricity in the 18th century. As technology advanced, the need for more precise measurements led to the development of the millivolt as a standard unit. The millivolt per second emerged as a practical unit for measuring dynamic changes in voltage, especially in modern electronic devices.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the millivolt per second unit, consider a sensor that outputs a voltage change of 50 mV over a time period of 2 seconds. The rate of change can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Rate of Change} = \frac{\text{Change in Voltage}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{50 \text{ mV}}{2 \text{ s}} = 25 \text{ mV/s} \]

### Use of the Units
Millivolt per second is particularly useful in applications such as:
- Monitoring the performance of electrical circuits.
- Analyzing sensor outputs in real-time.
- Evaluating the stability of voltage in electronic devices.
