Whether you're a student, engineer, or hobbyist, understanding electric potential is crucial in various applications, from circuit design to energy efficiency analysis.

### Definition
Electric potential, measured in volts (V), represents the potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field. The StatVolt tool enables users to convert electric potential values into various units, including statvolts, making it easier to work with different measurement systems.

### Standardization
The StatVolt adheres to international standards for electric potential measurements, ensuring consistency and reliability across various applications. The standard unit of electric potential is the volt, but the StatVolt tool allows conversions to and from statvolts and other relevant units, promoting a comprehensive understanding of electric potential.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electric potential has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. From the pioneering work of scientists like Coulomb and Volta, the understanding of electric potential has become foundational in modern electrical engineering. The introduction of tools like StatVolt reflects the ongoing need for precise conversions in an increasingly complex electrical landscape.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the functionality of StatVolt, consider converting 100 volts to statvolts. Using the conversion factor, 1 volt is equivalent to approximately 299.79 statvolts. Therefore, 100 volts can be converted as follows:

\[ 
100 \text{ V} \times 299.79 \text{ statV/V} = 29,979 \text{ statV} 
\]
