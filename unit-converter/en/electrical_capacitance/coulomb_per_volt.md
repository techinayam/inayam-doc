## Understanding Coulomb per Volt (C/V)

### Definition
Coulomb per Volt (C/V) is the unit of electrical capacitance in the International System of Units (SI). It quantifies the ability of a capacitor to store an electric charge per unit voltage. In simpler terms, it tells you how much charge can be stored in a capacitor for every volt applied across it. 

### Standardization
The unit of capacitance, the Farad (F), is defined as one coulomb per volt. Hence, 1 C/V is equivalent to 1 Farad. This standardization allows for consistent measurements and calculations across various electrical applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of capacitance has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. The term "capacitance" was first introduced in the 19th century as scientists began to understand the properties of capacitors. The Farad, named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, became the standard unit of capacitance in 1881. The coulomb, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is a fundamental unit of electric charge that has been in use since the late 18th century.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the coulomb per volt unit, consider a capacitor that stores 10 coulombs of charge when a voltage of 5 volts is applied. The capacitance can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Capacitance (C)} = \frac{\text{Charge (Q)}}{\text{Voltage (V)}} = \frac{10 \, \text{C}}{5 \, \text{V}} = 2 \, \text{F} \]

This means that the capacitor has a capacitance of 2 Farads.

### Use of the Units
Coulomb per Volt is crucial in various fields, including electrical engineering, physics, and electronics. It helps engineers design circuits and choose appropriate capacitors for specific applications, ensuring optimal performance and safety.
