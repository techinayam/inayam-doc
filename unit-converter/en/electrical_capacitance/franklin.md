## Franklin (Fr) - Electrical Capacitance Unit Converter

### Definition
The **franklin (Fr)** is a unit of electrical capacitance, named after the renowned American polymath Benjamin Franklin. It is a measure of a capacitor's ability to store electrical charge. One franklin is defined as the capacitance of a capacitor that stores one coulomb of electric charge at a potential difference of one volt. Understanding capacitance is crucial for various applications in electronics and electrical engineering.

### Standardization
The franklin is not commonly used in modern electrical engineering, as the farad (F) has become the standard unit of capacitance. However, the conversion between these units is essential for historical context and specific applications. The relationship between the two units is as follows: 1 franklin is equal to 1 farad.

### History and Evolution
The concept of capacitance and the unit of measurement have evolved significantly since the time of Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century. Franklin's experiments with electricity laid the groundwork for understanding capacitance. Over time, the farad was introduced as a more practical unit for measuring capacitance in electrical circuits, leading to the decline in the use of the franklin.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion from franklin to farad, consider a capacitor with a capacitance of 5 Fr. To convert this to farads, you would use the following calculation:

\[ 5 \, \text{Fr} = 5 \, \text{F} \]

### Use of the Units
While the franklin is largely of historical interest, it can still be beneficial for educational purposes and in specific contexts where older literature is referenced. Understanding both units allows engineers and students to grasp the evolution of electrical measurement.
