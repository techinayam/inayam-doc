## Joule per Volt (J/V) Converter Tool

### Definition
The Joule per Volt (J/V) is a derived unit of electrical conductance, representing the amount of energy (in joules) per unit of electric potential (in volts). This unit is essential in understanding electrical systems, where energy transfer and voltage play critical roles. 

### Standardization
The Joule per Volt is standardized within the International System of Units (SI), ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various applications. This standardization allows engineers and scientists to communicate effectively, facilitating collaboration in research and development.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical conductance has evolved significantly since the early days of electricity. The Joule, named after the physicist James Prescott Joule, represents energy, while the Volt, named after Alessandro Volta, signifies electric potential. The combination of these two units into Joule per Volt reflects the intricate relationship between energy and voltage in electrical systems.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of Joule per Volt, consider a scenario where a circuit operates at 10 volts and transfers 50 joules of energy. The conductance can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Conductance (J/V)} = \frac{\text{Energy (J)}}{\text{Voltage (V)}} = \frac{50 \text{ J}}{10 \text{ V}} = 5 \text{ J/V} \]

### Use of the Units
