## Kiloohm per Meter (kΩ/m) Tool Description

### Definition
Kiloohm per meter (kΩ/m) is a unit of measurement that quantifies electrical resistance in a material per unit length. It is commonly used in electrical engineering and physics to describe how much a material resists the flow of electric current over a specified distance. Understanding this unit is crucial for designing circuits and selecting appropriate materials for electrical applications.

### Standardization
The kiloohm per meter is derived from the ohm, which is the standard unit of electrical resistance in the International System of Units (SI). One kiloohm equals 1,000 ohms. This unit is standardized globally, ensuring consistency in measurements across various applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance dates back to the early 19th century with the work of scientists like Georg Simon Ohm, who formulated Ohm's Law. Over the years, the understanding and measurement of resistance have evolved significantly, leading to the adoption of various units, including the kiloohm per meter. This evolution has facilitated advancements in electrical engineering, allowing for more efficient designs and applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the kiloohm per meter unit, consider a copper wire with a resistance of 2 kΩ/m. If you have a 10-meter length of this wire, the total resistance can be calculated as follows:

Total Resistance (R) = Resistance per meter (R/m) × Length (L)
R = 2 kΩ/m × 10 m = 20 kΩ

### Use of the Units
Kiloohm per meter is particularly useful in applications involving long electrical conductors, such as power transmission lines, where resistance can significantly affect performance. It helps engineers and technicians assess the suitability of materials for specific applications, ensuring optimal performance and safety.
