## Megaohm (MΩ) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The megaohm (MΩ) is a unit of electrical resistance in the International System of Units (SI). It represents one million ohms (1 MΩ = 1,000,000 Ω). This unit is commonly used in various electrical and electronic applications to measure resistance, which is crucial for understanding how electrical circuits function.

### Standardization
The megaohm is standardized under the SI system, ensuring consistency and reliability in measurements across various fields, including engineering, physics, and electronics. This standardization is essential for professionals who require precise measurements for their projects.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance was first introduced by Georg Simon Ohm in the 1820s, leading to the formulation of Ohm's Law. Over the years, as technology advanced, the need for measuring resistance in larger scales became apparent, leading to the adoption of the megaohm as a standard unit. Today, the megaohm is widely used in industries such as telecommunications, automotive, and manufacturing.

### Example Calculation
To convert resistance from ohms to megaohms, simply divide the resistance value by 1,000,000. For instance, if you have a resistance of 5,000,000 ohms, the conversion to megaohms would be:
\[ 
5,000,000 \, \text{Ω} \div 1,000,000 = 5 \, \text{MΩ} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Megaohms are particularly useful in high-resistance applications, such as insulation testing and circuit design. Engineers and technicians often rely on this unit to ensure that components can handle the required resistance levels without failure.
