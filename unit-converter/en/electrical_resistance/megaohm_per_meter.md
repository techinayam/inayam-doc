## Megaohm per Meter (MΩ/m) Tool Description

### Definition
The megaohm per meter (MΩ/m) is a unit of electrical resistance that quantifies how much a material resists the flow of electric current over a specified length. This unit is particularly important in fields such as electrical engineering, materials science, and telecommunications, where understanding resistance is crucial for designing efficient circuits and systems.

### Standardization
The megaohm per meter is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the ohm, the standard unit of electrical resistance. One megaohm equals one million ohms (1 MΩ = 1,000,000 Ω). This standardization ensures consistency in measurements across various applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance dates back to the early 19th century, with Georg Simon Ohm being one of the first to quantify it through Ohm's Law. Over time, as technology advanced, the need for more precise measurements led to the development of various units, including the megaohm per meter. This evolution reflects the growing complexity of electrical systems and the need for accurate resistance measurements in modern applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of megaohm per meter, consider a wire with a resistance of 5 MΩ over a length of 10 meters. The resistance per meter can be calculated as follows:

\[ 
\text{Resistance per meter} = \frac{\text{Total Resistance}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{5 \, \text{MΩ}}{10 \, \text{m}} = 0.5 \, \text{MΩ/m} 
\]

This calculation helps engineers determine how resistance varies with length in different materials.
