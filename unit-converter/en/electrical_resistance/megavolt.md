## Megavolt (MV) Converter Tool

### Definition
The megavolt (MV) is a unit of electrical potential difference, equal to one million volts. It is commonly used in high-voltage applications, such as power transmission and electrical engineering. Understanding megavolts is crucial for professionals working in these fields, as it helps ensure the safe and efficient operation of electrical systems.

### Standardization
The megavolt is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the base unit of voltage, the volt (V). The standardization of electrical units, including the megavolt, allows for consistent communication and understanding across various scientific and engineering disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of voltage dates back to the 18th century with the work of pioneers like Alessandro Volta. The introduction of the megavolt as a unit emerged as electrical systems grew in complexity and scale, particularly during the 20th century with the expansion of power grids and high-voltage transmission lines.

### Example Calculation
To convert megavolts to volts, simply multiply by 1,000,000. For instance, if you have 5 megavolts (MV):
\[ 
5 \, \text{MV} \times 1,000,000 = 5,000,000 \, \text{V} 
\]
This conversion is essential for engineers who need to work with different voltage levels in their calculations.

### Use of the Units
Megavolts are predominantly used in high-voltage applications, such as:
- Power generation and transmission
