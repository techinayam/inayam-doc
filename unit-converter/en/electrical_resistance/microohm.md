## Microohm (µΩ) Tool Description

### Definition
The microohm (µΩ) is a unit of electrical resistance in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to one-millionth of an ohm (1 µΩ = 10^-6 Ω). This unit is crucial in various electrical applications, particularly in measuring very low resistances, which are common in high-performance electrical components and circuits.

### Standardization
The microohm is standardized under the SI system, ensuring consistency and reliability in measurements across different applications and industries. This standardization is vital for engineers and technicians who require precise resistance values for their projects.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance dates back to the early 19th century, with Georg Simon Ohm's formulation of Ohm's Law in 1827. As technology advanced, the need for measuring smaller resistances led to the introduction of the microohm. Today, it is widely used in fields such as electronics, telecommunications, and electrical engineering.

### Example Calculation
To convert resistance from ohms to microohms, simply multiply the resistance value by 1,000,000. For example, if a resistor has a resistance of 0.005 ohms, the equivalent resistance in microohms would be:

0.005 Ω × 1,000,000 = 5,000 µΩ

### Use of the Units
Microohms are particularly useful in applications where low resistance is critical, such as in battery testing, wire connections, and circuit board manufacturing. Accurate measurements in microohms can help ensure the efficiency and reliability of electrical systems.
