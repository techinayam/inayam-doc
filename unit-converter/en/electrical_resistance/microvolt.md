## Microvolt (µV) Converter Tool

### Definition
The microvolt (µV) is a unit of electrical potential equal to one-millionth of a volt. It is commonly used in fields such as electronics, telecommunications, and biomedical engineering to measure very low voltages. Understanding microvolts is essential for professionals working with sensitive electronic equipment and systems.

### Standardization
The microvolt is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized to ensure consistency across various applications and industries. The symbol for microvolt is µV, and it is derived from the metric prefix "micro," which denotes a factor of 10^-6. 

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring electrical potential dates back to the early 19th century with the work of pioneers like Alessandro Volta and Georg Simon Ohm. Over the years, the microvolt has evolved as technology advanced, allowing for more precise measurements in various applications, including medical devices and scientific research.

### Example Calculation
To convert volts to microvolts, simply multiply the voltage value by 1,000,000. For instance, if you have a voltage of 0.005 volts, the calculation would be:
\[ 
0.005 \text{ volts} \times 1,000,000 = 5000 \text{ µV} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Microvolts are particularly useful in applications where low voltage measurements are critical, such as in electrocardiograms (ECGs), electromyography (EMG), and other medical diagnostics. Additionally, they are used in precision electronics and research settings where minute voltage variations can significantly impact results.
