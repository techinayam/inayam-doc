## Milliohm (mΩ) Converter Tool

### Definition
The milliohm (mΩ) is a subunit of electrical resistance in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to one-thousandth of an ohm (Ω), which is the standard unit of electrical resistance. The milliohm is particularly useful in applications where very low resistance values are measured, such as in electrical circuits and components.

### Standardization
The milliohm is standardized under the SI units, ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various applications. It is commonly used in electrical engineering, electronics, and physics to quantify resistance in low-resistance scenarios.

### History and Evolution
The concept of electrical resistance was first introduced by Georg Simon Ohm in the 1820s, leading to the formulation of Ohm's Law. As technology advanced, the need for measuring lower resistance values became apparent, resulting in the adoption of subunits like the milliohm. Today, the milliohm is widely used in industries ranging from telecommunications to automotive engineering.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of milliohms, consider a circuit where a resistor has a resistance of 0.005 Ω. To convert this value into milliohms, you would multiply by 1,000:
\[ 
0.005 \, \Omega \times 1000 = 5 \, m\Omega 
\]
This conversion is essential for precise measurements in low-resistance applications.

### Use of the Units
Milliohms are primarily used in:
- Electrical circuit design
- Measuring the resistance of wires and connectors
- Evaluating the performance of electrical components
- Quality control in manufacturing processes
