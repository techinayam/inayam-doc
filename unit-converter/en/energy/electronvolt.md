## Electronvolt (eV) Tool Description

### Definition
The electronvolt (eV) is a unit of energy commonly used in the fields of physics and chemistry. It is defined as the amount of kinetic energy gained or lost by a single electron when it is accelerated through an electric potential difference of one volt. This unit is particularly useful for measuring small amounts of energy, such as those encountered in atomic and subatomic processes.

### Standardization
The electronvolt is part of the International System of Units (SI) but is not an SI unit itself. Instead, it is derived from the SI unit of energy, the joule (J). Specifically, 1 eV is equivalent to approximately \(1.602 \times 10^{-19}\) joules. This relationship allows for easy conversion between electronvolts and joules, making it a versatile unit in scientific calculations.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the electronvolt emerged in the early 20th century as physicists began to explore the behavior of electrons and other subatomic particles. The term was first used in 1900, and since then, it has become a standard unit in various scientific disciplines, including particle physics, quantum mechanics, and solid-state physics. Its widespread adoption reflects the growing importance of understanding energy at the atomic level.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the electronvolt, consider a scenario where an electron is accelerated through a potential difference of 5 volts. The energy gained by the electron can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Energy (eV)} = \text{Charge (C)} \times \text{Voltage (V)} = (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \times (5 \text{ V}) = 8.01 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \approx 5 \text{ eV}
\]

### Use of the Units
The electronvolt is predominantly used in fields such as:
- **Particle Physics:** To express the energy of particles in accelerators.
