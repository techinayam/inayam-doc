## Foot-Pound (ft·lb) Energy Converter Tool

### Definition
The foot-pound (ft·lb) is a unit of energy or work in the imperial system. It is defined as the amount of energy transferred when a force of one pound is applied over a distance of one foot. This unit is commonly used in various fields, including engineering, physics, and mechanics, to quantify energy, work, and torque.

### Standardization
The foot-pound is part of the British Imperial System and is standardized in various engineering applications. It is essential for ensuring consistency in measurements across different disciplines. The foot-pound is often used in conjunction with other units such as joules and newtons to provide a comprehensive understanding of energy and work.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the foot-pound dates back to the early days of mechanical engineering and physics. It was developed to provide a practical means of measuring energy in systems that utilized the imperial unit of measurement. Over the years, the foot-pound has remained a vital unit in the engineering community, especially in the United States, where imperial units are still widely used.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the foot-pound, consider a scenario where a force of 10 pounds is applied over a distance of 5 feet. The energy expended can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Energy (ft·lb)} = \text{Force (lb)} \times \text{Distance (ft)} \]
\[ \text{Energy} = 10 \, \text{lb} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 50 \, \text{ft·lb} \]

### Use of the Units
Foot-pounds are commonly used in various applications, including:
- Calculating work done in mechanical systems.
- Measuring torque in engines and machinery.
- Evaluating energy consumption in residential and industrial settings.
