## Kilowatt-Hour (kWh) Tool Description

The **kilowatt-hour (kWh)** is a standard unit of energy commonly used to measure electricity consumption. It represents the amount of energy consumed when a device with a power rating of one kilowatt operates for one hour. Understanding kWh is essential for managing energy usage effectively, whether for residential, commercial, or industrial applications.

### Standardization

The kilowatt-hour is standardized under the International System of Units (SI) and is widely accepted across various industries. It is essential for energy billing, allowing consumers to understand their electricity usage and costs clearly. 

### History and Evolution

The concept of the kilowatt-hour emerged in the late 19th century as electricity became a common utility. With the advent of electric power generation and distribution, the need for a standardized measure of energy consumption became crucial. Over the years, the kWh has evolved to become a fundamental unit in energy management and sustainability discussions.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to calculate kWh, consider a 100-watt light bulb used for 10 hours. The calculation would be:

\[ \text{kWh} = \frac{\text{Power (in watts)}}{1000} \times \text{Time (in hours)} \]

\[ \text{kWh} = \frac{100 \text{ watts}}{1000} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ kWh} \]

### Use of the Units

The kilowatt-hour is primarily used in electricity billing, energy consumption analysis, and efficiency assessments. It helps consumers understand their energy usage patterns and make informed decisions about energy conservation.
