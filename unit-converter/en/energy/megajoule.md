## Megajoule (MJ) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The **megajoule (MJ)** is a unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). It is equivalent to one million joules and is commonly used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and energy consumption analysis. Understanding the megajoule is essential for accurately measuring energy outputs and inputs in both theoretical and practical applications.

### Standardization
The megajoule is standardized under the SI unit system, ensuring consistency and reliability in measurements across different scientific and engineering disciplines. This standardization allows for seamless communication and comparison of energy values globally.

### History and Evolution
The concept of energy measurement has evolved significantly over time. The joule, named after the British physicist James Prescott Joule, was established in the mid-19th century. The megajoule emerged as a larger unit to facilitate the measurement of energy in contexts where joules would be impractically small, such as in electricity generation and large-scale energy consumption.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of megajoules, consider the energy consumption of a light bulb. If a 60-watt bulb is used for 10 hours, the energy consumed can be calculated as follows:

Energy (in joules) = Power (in watts) × Time (in seconds)  
Energy = 60 W × (10 hours × 3600 seconds/hour) = 2160000 joules  
Converting this to megajoules:  
Energy = 2160000 J ÷ 1,000,000 = 2.16 MJ

### Use of the Units
Megajoules are widely utilized in various applications, including:
- Energy consumption in households and industries
- Fuel energy content measurement
- Renewable energy assessments
- Scientific research and experiments
