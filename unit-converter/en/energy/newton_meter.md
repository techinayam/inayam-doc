## Newton Meter (N·m) Tool Description

The **Newton Meter (N·m)** is a vital unit of measurement in the field of physics and engineering, representing torque or rotational force. This tool allows users to convert and understand the relationship between force and distance, making it essential for various applications, from mechanical engineering to physics experiments.

### Definition
A Newton Meter is defined as the torque resulting from a force of one Newton applied perpendicularly to a lever arm that is one meter long. It is a crucial unit when dealing with rotational dynamics, ensuring that calculations involving torque are accurate and meaningful.

### Standardization
The Newton Meter is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements across scientific disciplines. This standardization ensures consistency and reliability in calculations, making it easier for professionals and students alike to communicate their findings effectively.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has been studied since ancient times, but the formal definition of the Newton Meter was established with the development of the SI system in the 20th century. Over the years, the understanding of torque and its applications has evolved, leading to advancements in engineering and technology.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the Newton Meter, consider a scenario where a force of 10 N is applied at the end of a 2-meter-long lever arm. The torque can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Torque (N·m)} = \text{Force (N)} \times \text{Distance (m)} \]
\[ \text{Torque} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 20 \, \text{N·m} \]

### Use of the Units
Newton Meters are commonly used in various fields, including:
- Mechanical engineering for designing machines and structures.
- Automotive engineering to measure engine torque.
- Physics experiments to study rotational motion.
