## Therm (thm) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The therm (symbol: thm) is a unit of heat energy that is commonly used in the natural gas industry. One therm is equivalent to 100,000 British thermal units (BTUs) or approximately 29.3 kilowatt-hours (kWh). This unit is essential for measuring energy consumption, particularly in heating applications.

### Standardization
The therm is standardized under the International System of Units (SI) for energy measurement. It is particularly relevant in countries where natural gas is a primary source of heating and energy. Understanding this unit helps consumers and businesses alike to gauge their energy usage and costs effectively.

### History and Evolution
The therm has its roots in the early 19th century when the need for a standardized unit of heat energy became apparent due to the industrial revolution. As natural gas became a popular energy source, the therm emerged as a practical unit for measuring energy content, allowing for better pricing and consumption tracking.

### Example Calculation
To convert therms to kilowatt-hours (kWh), you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Energy (kWh)} = \text{Energy (thm)} \times 29.3 \]
For instance, if you have 5 therms:
\[ 5 \, \text{thm} \times 29.3 \, \text{kWh/thm} = 146.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

### Use of the Units
The therm is widely used in residential and commercial heating systems, especially in regions that rely heavily on natural gas. It is also utilized in energy audits, utility billing, and energy efficiency assessments.
