## Milligram per Hour (mg/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The milligram per hour (mg/h) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the flow rate of a substance in terms of mass over time. It is commonly used in various fields such as pharmacology, chemistry, and environmental science to measure the rate at which a substance is administered or released.

### Standardization
The milligram per hour is part of the metric system, where one milligram is equal to one-thousandth of a gram. This unit is standardized globally, ensuring consistency in measurements across different applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring flow rates dates back to the early days of scientific inquiry. As the need for precision in measurements grew, the milligram became a crucial unit in laboratories and industries. Over time, the milligram per hour has evolved to become a standard unit for expressing flow rates in various scientific and industrial applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the milligram per hour, consider a scenario where a medication is administered at a rate of 500 mg/h. If a patient requires this dosage for 4 hours, the total amount of medication administered would be calculated as follows:

Total dosage = Flow rate × Time
Total dosage = 500 mg/h × 4 h = 2000 mg

### Use of the Units
Milligram per hour is particularly useful in fields such as:
- **Pharmacology**: To determine drug dosages.
- **Environmental Science**: To measure pollutant emissions.
- **Food Industry**: To quantify additive concentrations.
