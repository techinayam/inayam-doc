## Ounce Per Hour (oz/h) Converter Tool

### Definition
The ounce per hour (oz/h) is a unit of measurement used to quantify flow rates, specifically in terms of mass. It indicates the number of ounces that flow or are processed in one hour. This unit is particularly useful in various industries, including food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and chemical processing, where precise measurements of mass flow are essential.

### Standardization
The ounce is a customary unit of mass in the United States and is defined as 1/16 of a pound. In the context of flow rates, ounce per hour allows for the standardization of measurements across different applications, ensuring consistency and accuracy in calculations.

### History and Evolution
The ounce has a rich history, tracing back to ancient Roman and medieval European systems of measurement. Over time, it has evolved into a widely accepted unit in various fields. The ounce per hour specifically gained prominence with the rise of industrial processes requiring precise flow rate measurements, making it an essential tool for engineers and scientists alike.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the utility of the ounce per hour, consider a scenario where a beverage factory needs to determine the flow rate of a syrup. If the factory processes 240 ounces of syrup in 2 hours, the flow rate can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Flow Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Ounces}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{240 \text{ oz}}{2 \text{ h}} = 120 \text{ oz/h} \]

### Use of the Units
The ounce per hour is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Food and beverage production
- Chemical processing
- Pharmaceutical manufacturing
- Environmental monitoring
