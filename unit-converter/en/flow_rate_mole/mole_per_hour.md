## Mole Per Hour (mol/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The mole per hour (mol/h) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the flow rate of a substance in terms of moles per hour. This metric is essential in various scientific fields, including chemistry and engineering, where understanding the rate of chemical reactions or processes is crucial.

### Standardization
The mole is a standard unit in the International System of Units (SI), representing a specific quantity of particles, typically atoms or molecules. The mole per hour standardizes the measurement of flow rates, allowing for consistent calculations across different scientific disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the mole was introduced in the early 20th century as part of the development of atomic theory. Over time, the mole has become integral to stoichiometry and chemical equations, facilitating the understanding of reactions and the quantities of reactants and products involved.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of mole per hour, consider a chemical reaction where 2 moles of substance A react with 1 mole of substance B to produce 1 mole of substance C. If the reaction occurs at a rate of 3 mol/h for substance A, the flow rate for substance B would be 1.5 mol/h, and the production rate for substance C would be 1.5 mol/h.

### Use of the Units
Mole per hour is widely used in laboratory settings, chemical manufacturing, and environmental monitoring. It helps chemists and engineers determine the efficiency of reactions, optimize processes, and ensure safety standards are met.
