## Cubic Centimeter per Hour (cm³/h) Tool Description

### Definition
Cubic centimeter per hour (cm³/h) is a unit of volumetric flow rate that measures the volume of fluid that passes through a given point in one hour. It is commonly used in various fields such as engineering, fluid dynamics, and medical applications to quantify the flow of liquids and gases.

### Standardization
The cubic centimeter (cm³) is a metric unit of volume that is standardized by the International System of Units (SI). One cubic centimeter is equivalent to one milliliter (mL), making it a convenient unit for measuring small volumes. The flow rate in cm³/h is particularly useful in applications where precise measurements of fluid flow are required.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring flow rates dates back to ancient civilizations, where water flow was crucial for agriculture and irrigation. The metric system, established in France during the late 18th century, introduced standardized units like the cubic centimeter. Over the years, the use of cm³/h has evolved, becoming essential in scientific research, industrial processes, and healthcare settings.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the cubic centimeter per hour measurement, consider a scenario where a pump delivers 500 cm³ of water in 2 hours. To calculate the flow rate in cm³/h, use the formula:

\[ \text{Flow Rate (cm³/h)} = \frac{\text{Total Volume (cm³)}}{\text{Time (h)}} \]

In this case:

\[ \text{Flow Rate} = \frac{500 \text{ cm³}}{2 \text{ h}} = 250 \text{ cm³/h} \]

### Use of the Units
Cubic centimeter per hour is widely used in various applications, including:
- Medical devices for administering fluids, such as IV drips.
- Laboratory experiments where precise fluid measurements are critical.
- Industrial processes involving the flow of liquids in manufacturing.
