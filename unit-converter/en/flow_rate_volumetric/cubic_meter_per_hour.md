## Cubic Meter Per Hour (m³/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The cubic meter per hour (m³/h) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the flow rate of a fluid. It represents the volume of fluid that passes through a given point in one hour. This metric is crucial in various applications, including engineering, environmental science, and fluid dynamics, where understanding the flow of liquids and gases is essential.

### Standardization
The cubic meter is a standard unit of volume in the International System of Units (SI). The flow rate in cubic meters per hour is widely accepted in scientific and industrial contexts, providing a consistent basis for measurement across different fields. 

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fluid flow dates back centuries, evolving with advancements in technology and engineering. The cubic meter as a unit of volume was officially adopted in the late 18th century, and the flow rate measurement in cubic meters per hour has since become a standard in various industries, including water treatment, HVAC systems, and chemical processing.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of cubic meters per hour, consider a water pump that delivers 500 m³ of water in 10 hours. To find the flow rate in m³/h, simply divide the total volume by the time:
\[ 
\text{Flow Rate} = \frac{500 \, \text{m}³}{10 \, \text{h}} = 50 \, \text{m}³/h 
\]

### Use of the Units
Cubic meters per hour is commonly used in various applications, such as:
- Water supply systems
- Industrial processes
- HVAC systems
- Environmental monitoring
