## Milliliter per Hour (mL/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The milliliter per hour (mL/h) is a unit of measurement used to quantify the flow rate of liquids. It indicates how many milliliters of liquid pass through a specific point in one hour. This measurement is crucial in various fields, including medicine, chemistry, and engineering, where precise fluid delivery is essential.

### Standardization
Milliliters are part of the metric system, which is standardized internationally. One milliliter is equivalent to one cubic centimeter (cm³), and there are 1,000 milliliters in a liter. The milliliter per hour unit is commonly used in medical settings for intravenous (IV) fluid administration, ensuring patients receive the correct dosage over time.

### History and Evolution
The metric system, including the milliliter, was developed in France during the late 18th century. The concept of measuring liquid flow rates emerged as industries and healthcare systems began to require precise measurements for safety and efficacy. Over the years, the use of mL/h has expanded across various sectors, making it a standard unit for flow rate measurement.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the usage of the milliliter per hour unit, consider a scenario where a medical professional needs to administer 500 mL of saline solution over a period of 4 hours. The calculation for the flow rate in mL/h would be:

\[
\text{Flow Rate (mL/h)} = \frac{\text{Total Volume (mL)}}{\text{Total Time (h)}} = \frac{500 \text{ mL}}{4 \text{ h}} = 125 \text{ mL/h}
\]

### Use of the Units
Milliliters per hour are widely used in various applications, including:
- Medical IV fluid administration
- Laboratory experiments requiring precise liquid flow
- Industrial processes involving liquid transport
