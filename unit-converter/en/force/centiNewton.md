## CentiNewton (cN) Tool Description

### Definition
The centiNewton (cN) is a unit of force that is equal to one-hundredth (1/100) of a Newton (N). It is a metric unit commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications to measure force. Understanding the centiNewton is essential for precise calculations in fields such as physics, engineering, and material science.

### Standardization
The centiNewton is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the Newton, which is defined as the force required to accelerate a one-kilogram mass by one meter per second squared (1 N = 1 kg·m/s²). The centiNewton allows for more granular measurements of force, making it particularly useful in applications where small forces are involved.

### History and Evolution
The concept of force has evolved significantly since Sir Isaac Newton first formulated his laws of motion in the 17th century. The Newton was named in his honor and became the standard unit of force in the SI system. The centiNewton emerged as a practical subunit to facilitate measurements in various scientific experiments and engineering applications, allowing for greater precision without the need for cumbersome decimal representations.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the centiNewton, consider an object with a mass of 0.5 kg that is subjected to an acceleration of 2 m/s². The force exerted on the object can be calculated using Newton's second law of motion (F = m·a):

\[ 
F = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \times 2 \, \text{m/s}² = 1 \, \text{N} 
\]

To convert this force into centiNewtons:

\[ 
1 \, \text{N} = 100 \, \text{cN} 
\]

Thus, the force exerted on the object is 100 centiNewtons.

### Use of the Units
CentiNewtons are widely used in various fields, including:
- **Engineering**: For precise calculations in mechanical systems.
