## Foot-Pound Force Converter Tool

### Definition
The foot-pound force (ft·lbf) is a unit of energy or work in the Imperial system, defined as the amount of energy transferred when a force of one pound is applied over a distance of one foot. It is commonly used in engineering and physics to quantify work done or energy expended in mechanical systems.

### Standardization
The foot-pound force is standardized within the Imperial system, ensuring consistent measurements across various applications. It is essential for engineers and scientists to use standardized units to maintain accuracy and reliability in calculations and experiments.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the foot-pound force has its roots in the early days of mechanical engineering. The unit has evolved over time, with its origins traceable back to the British Imperial system. Understanding its historical context helps users appreciate its relevance in modern engineering and physics.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the foot-pound force, consider lifting a weight of 10 pounds to a height of 3 feet. The work done can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Work} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \]
\[ \text{Work} = 10 \, \text{lbs} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 30 \, \text{ft·lbf} \]
