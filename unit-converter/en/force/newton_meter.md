## Newton Meter (N·m) Tool Description

The **Newton Meter (N·m)** is a vital unit of measurement in the field of physics and engineering, representing torque or rotational force. This tool allows users to convert and understand the relationship between force and distance, providing clarity in various applications, from mechanical engineering to everyday tasks.

### Definition
A Newton Meter is defined as the torque resulting from a force of one Newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one meter long. It plays a crucial role in understanding how forces interact with objects in rotational motion.

### Standardization
The Newton Meter is part of the International System of Units (SI), ensuring consistency and standardization across scientific disciplines. This uniformity allows for accurate communication of measurements in global research and engineering projects.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has been studied since the days of classical mechanics. The term "Newton" honors Sir Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion laid the groundwork for modern physics. Over time, the Newton Meter has evolved into a standard unit used in various fields, including automotive engineering, construction, and physics.

### Example Calculation
To calculate torque in Newton Meters, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Torque (N·m)} = \text{Force (N)} \times \text{Distance (m)} \]
For example, if a force of 10 N is applied at a distance of 2 m from the pivot point, the torque would be:
\[ 10 \, \text{N} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 20 \, \text{N·m} \]

### Use of the Units
Newton Meters are widely used in various applications, including:
- Measuring the torque in engines and machinery.
- Calculating the force required to turn bolts and screws.
- Evaluating the performance of mechanical systems.
