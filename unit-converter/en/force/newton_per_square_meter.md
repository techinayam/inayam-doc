## Newton per Square Meter (N/m²) Tool Description

### Definition
The Newton per square meter (N/m²), commonly referred to as a Pascal (Pa), is a unit of pressure that quantifies the amount of force applied over a unit area. It is a fundamental unit in the International System of Units (SI) and is widely used in various scientific and engineering fields. Understanding pressure in N/m² is essential for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to material science.

### Standardization
The Pascal is defined as one newton of force applied uniformly over an area of one square meter. This standardization allows for consistent measurements across different disciplines, making it easier to communicate and compare results.

### History and Evolution
The concept of pressure has been studied for centuries, with early contributions from scientists like Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. The unit of Pascal was officially adopted in 1971 as part of the SI units, providing a standardized measure for pressure that is now universally recognized.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the N/m² unit, consider a scenario where a force of 10 N is applied over an area of 2 m². The pressure can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Pressure (Pa)} = \frac{\text{Force (N)}}{\text{Area (m²)}} \]

\[ \text{Pressure} = \frac{10 \, \text{N}}{2 \, \text{m²}} = 5 \, \text{N/m²} \]

### Use of the Units
The Newton per square meter is utilized in various fields, including:
- **Engineering**: To assess material strength and structural integrity.
- **Meteorology**: To measure atmospheric pressure.
- **Hydraulics**: To calculate fluid pressure in systems.
