## Torque Converter Tool

### Definition
Torque, represented by the symbol N·m (Newton meter), is a measure of rotational force. It quantifies the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, pivot point, or fulcrum. Understanding torque is essential in various fields, including engineering, automotive, and physics, as it plays a crucial role in the performance and efficiency of machines and vehicles.

### Standardization
Torque is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) as Newton meters (N·m). This unit reflects the force applied (in Newtons) at a distance (in meters) from the pivot point. Other units of torque may include foot-pounds (ft·lb) and inch-pounds (in·lb), but N·m is the most widely accepted in scientific and engineering contexts.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has evolved over centuries, with early applications in mechanics dating back to ancient civilizations. The term "torque" itself was popularized in the 19th century as engineers began to understand the importance of rotational forces in machinery. Today, torque is a fundamental concept in mechanical engineering, influencing the design and operation of engines, gears, and various mechanical systems.

### Example Calculation
To calculate torque, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Torque (N·m)} = \text{Force (N)} \times \text{Distance (m)} \]
For instance, if a force of 10 N is applied at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot point, the torque would be:
\[ \text{Torque} = 10 \, \text{N} \times 0.5 \, \text{m} = 5 \, \text{N·m} \]

### Use of the Units
Torque is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Automotive Engineering**: Determining the power output of engines and the efficiency of drivetrain systems.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Designing tools and machinery that require precise rotational force.
