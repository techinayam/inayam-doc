## Cycles Per Second (CPS) Tool Description

### Definition
Cycles per second (CPS) is a unit of frequency that quantifies the number of cycles or oscillations occurring in one second. This measurement is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and audio technology, as it helps in understanding waveforms, sound frequencies, and other periodic phenomena.

### Standardization
The cycles per second unit is often standardized to Hertz (Hz), where 1 CPS is equivalent to 1 Hz. This standardization allows for easier communication and understanding across different scientific and engineering disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring frequency dates back to the early studies of oscillatory motion in the 19th century. Initially referred to as cycles per second, the term Hertz was adopted in honor of Heinrich Hertz, a pioneer in electromagnetic wave research. Today, CPS remains a widely recognized term, particularly in educational contexts.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of CPS, consider a sound wave that completes 440 cycles in one second. This frequency can be expressed as 440 CPS or 440 Hz, which is the standard pitch for tuning musical instruments.

### Use of the Units
CPS is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Audio engineering to measure sound frequencies.
- Electronics to assess signal frequencies.
- Physics to analyze wave phenomena.
