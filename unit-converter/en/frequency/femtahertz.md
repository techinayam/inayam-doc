## Femtahertz (fHz) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
Femtahertz (fHz) is a unit of frequency that represents one quadrillionth (10^-15) of a hertz. It is primarily used in the field of physics and engineering to measure extremely high-frequency signals, such as those found in optical and quantum systems. Understanding femtahertz is crucial for researchers and professionals working with advanced technologies, including telecommunications and spectroscopy.

### Standardization
The femtahertz is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is derived from the hertz (Hz), which is the standard unit of frequency. One femtahertz is equal to 1 x 10^-15 hertz, making it a vital unit for expressing frequencies in the terahertz and optical ranges.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency measurement has evolved significantly since the introduction of the hertz in the late 19th century. As technology advanced, the need for measuring higher frequencies led to the adoption of subunits like femtahertz. This evolution has enabled scientists to explore and manipulate light and electromagnetic waves at unprecedented scales, paving the way for innovations in various fields.

### Example Calculation
To convert a frequency of 500 terahertz (THz) to femtahertz (fHz), you would use the following calculation:
\[ 
500 \, \text{THz} = 500 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Hz} = 500 \times 10^{12} \times 10^{15} \, \text{fHz} = 500 \times 10^{3} \, \text{fHz} = 500,000 \, \text{fHz} 
\]
