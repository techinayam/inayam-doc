## Frequency Converter Tool

### Definition
Frequency is defined as the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. It is measured in hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to one cycle per second. This tool allows users to convert between various frequency units, including kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), gigahertz (GHz), and more.

### Standardization
The International System of Units (SI) standardizes frequency measurements, with hertz being the base unit. Other units such as kilohertz, megahertz, and gigahertz are derived from the hertz and are commonly used in various fields, including telecommunications, audio engineering, and physics.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially, frequency was used primarily in the context of sound waves. However, with advancements in technology, the term has expanded to encompass electromagnetic waves, including radio and microwave frequencies. The development of digital technology has further increased the importance of frequency measurement in everyday applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the frequency converter, consider a scenario where you need to convert 1000 hertz to kilohertz. Using the conversion formula:
\[ 1 kHz = 1000 Hz \]
Thus, 1000 Hz is equal to 1 kHz.

### Use of the Units
Frequency units are widely used in various applications:
- **Telecommunications**: Frequencies are crucial for signal transmission in mobile phones and radio broadcasting.
- **Audio Engineering**: Understanding frequency helps in sound design and music production.
- **Physics**: Frequency plays a vital role in wave mechanics and quantum physics.
