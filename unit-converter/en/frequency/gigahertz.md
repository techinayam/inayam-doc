## Gigahertz (GHz) Frequency Converter Tool

### Definition
Gigahertz (GHz) is a unit of frequency that represents one billion hertz (cycles per second). It is commonly used to measure the frequency of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, microwaves, and signals in computing and telecommunications. Understanding gigahertz is essential for professionals in fields such as electronics, telecommunications, and computer science.

### Standardization
The gigahertz is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized to ensure consistency across various applications. The symbol "GHz" is universally recognized and used in scientific literature, technical specifications, and consumer electronics.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency measurement has evolved significantly since the early days of radio communication. The term "hertz" was named after Heinrich Hertz, who contributed to the understanding of electromagnetic waves in the late 19th century. As technology advanced, the need for higher frequency measurements led to the adoption of the gigahertz scale, which has become a standard in modern electronics, particularly in the specification of processor speeds and wireless communication.

### Example Calculation
To convert frequency from megahertz (MHz) to gigahertz (GHz), you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Frequency (GHz)} = \frac{\text{Frequency (MHz)}}{1000} \]

For example, if you have a frequency of 2400 MHz:
\[ \text{Frequency (GHz)} = \frac{2400 \text{ MHz}}{1000} = 2.4 \text{ GHz} \]

### Use of the Units
Gigahertz is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Computer Processors**: The speed of CPUs is often measured in gigahertz, indicating how many cycles per second the processor can execute.
- **Wireless Communication**: Frequencies for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks are often expressed in gigahertz.
- **Television and Radio Broadcasting**: Gigahertz is used to specify the frequency of broadcast signals.
