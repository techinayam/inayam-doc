## Hertz (Hz) Frequency Converter Tool

### Definition
Hertz (Hz) is the unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI). It quantifies the number of cycles per second of a periodic phenomenon, such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and mechanical vibrations. One hertz is equivalent to one cycle per second, making it a fundamental unit in various fields, including physics, engineering, and telecommunications.

### Standardization
The hertz is standardized by the International System of Units (SI) and is widely accepted across scientific disciplines. It is essential for ensuring consistency in measurements and calculations involving frequency. The symbol for hertz is "Hz," and it is commonly used in various applications, from audio frequencies to radio waves.

### History and Evolution
The term "hertz" was named after the German physicist Heinrich Hertz, who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves in the late 19th century. The unit was officially adopted in 1960, replacing the previously used term "cycles per second" (cps). Since then, hertz has become the standard unit for measuring frequency, reflecting advancements in technology and science.

### Example Calculation
To convert frequencies, you can use the following example: If you have a sound wave oscillating at 440 Hz (the standard pitch for musical tuning), this means it completes 440 cycles in one second. If you want to convert this frequency to kilohertz (kHz), you would divide by 1,000, resulting in 0.44 kHz.

### Use of the Units
Hertz is used in various applications, including:
- Audio engineering (measuring sound frequencies)
- Telecommunications (radio frequencies)
- Medical equipment (monitoring heart rates)
- Engineering (vibration analysis)
