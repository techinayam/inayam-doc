## Understanding the Hundred Hertz Tool

### Definition
The hundred hertz (hHz) is a unit of frequency that represents one hundred cycles per second. It is commonly used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and audio technology, to measure the frequency of sound waves, electrical signals, and other periodic phenomena. 

### Standardization
The hertz (Hz) is the standard unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI). One hertz is defined as one cycle per second. Therefore, 100 hertz (hHz) signifies 100 cycles occurring in one second, making it a crucial measurement in both theoretical and practical applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, frequency was measured in cycles per minute (CPM) before the adoption of the hertz in the late 19th century. The term "hertz" was named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves. As technology advanced, the need for precise frequency measurements led to the widespread use of hHz in various scientific and engineering disciplines.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the hundred hertz, consider a sound wave that completes 100 cycles in one second. If you were to measure the frequency of this sound wave, you would find it to be 100 hHz. This frequency can be crucial in audio engineering, where specific frequencies correspond to different musical notes.

### Use of the Units
The hundred hertz unit is particularly useful in audio production, telecommunications, and electronics. It helps engineers and technicians determine the frequency of signals, ensuring that devices operate within their intended specifications. Additionally, understanding frequency is essential for sound design, music production, and various scientific research applications.
