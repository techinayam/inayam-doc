## Megahertz (MHz) Frequency Converter Tool

### Definition
Megahertz (MHz) is a unit of frequency equal to one million hertz (cycles per second). It is commonly used to measure the frequency of electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, sound waves, and computer processor speeds. Understanding megahertz is essential for various applications, from telecommunications to audio engineering.

### Standardization
The megahertz is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized to ensure consistency in measurements across different fields. The symbol for megahertz is MHz, and it is widely recognized in scientific and engineering communities globally.

### History and Evolution
The term "megahertz" emerged in the mid-20th century as technology advanced, particularly in the fields of telecommunications and computing. As devices became more sophisticated, the need for higher frequency measurements led to the adoption of megahertz as a standard unit. Over the years, it has played a crucial role in the development of radio broadcasting, digital communications, and computer processing.

### Example Calculation
To convert frequency from hertz (Hz) to megahertz (MHz), simply divide the number of hertz by one million. For example, if a signal operates at 5,000,000 Hz, the conversion to megahertz would be:
\[ 
5,000,000 \, \text{Hz} \div 1,000,000 = 5 \, \text{MHz} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Megahertz is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Telecommunications:** for measuring radio frequencies.
- **Computing:** to indicate processor speeds.
- **Audio Engineering:** to define sound wave frequencies.
