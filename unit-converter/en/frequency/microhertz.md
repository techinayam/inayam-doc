## Microhertz (μHz) Tool Description

### Definition
Microhertz (μHz) is a unit of frequency that represents one-millionth of a hertz. It is commonly used in various scientific fields, particularly in physics and engineering, to measure extremely low frequencies. Understanding microhertz is crucial for applications involving sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and other phenomena where precise frequency measurements are essential.

### Standardization
Microhertz is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements across various scientific disciplines. The symbol for microhertz is μHz, and it is derived from the base unit hertz (Hz), which measures cycles per second. The SI unit system ensures that microhertz is universally recognized and utilized in scientific literature and applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency has evolved significantly since its inception. The term "hertz" was named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves in the late 19th century. As technology advanced, the need for measuring lower frequencies led to the adoption of subunits like microhertz, enabling researchers and engineers to work with more precise measurements.

### Example Calculation
To convert a frequency from hertz to microhertz, you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Frequency in μHz} = \text{Frequency in Hz} \times 1,000,000 \]

For instance, if you have a frequency of 0.005 Hz, the conversion to microhertz would be:
\[ 0.005 \, \text{Hz} \times 1,000,000 = 5000 \, \mu\text{Hz} \]

### Use of the Units
Microhertz is particularly useful in fields such as seismology, where it is used to measure the frequency of seismic waves, and in electronics, where it can describe the frequency of signals in low-frequency circuits. Understanding how to convert and utilize microhertz is essential for professionals working in these areas.
