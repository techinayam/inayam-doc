## Millihertz (mHz) Converter Tool

### Definition
Millihertz (mHz) is a unit of frequency that represents one-thousandth of a hertz (Hz). It is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications to measure low-frequency signals. Understanding millihertz is essential for professionals working in fields such as telecommunications, audio engineering, and physics.

### Standardization
The millihertz is part of the International System of Units (SI), where the hertz is the base unit for frequency. One millihertz is defined as one cycle per second divided by 1,000. This standardization ensures consistency across various applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency dates back to the early 19th century, with the term "hertz" being named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves. The millihertz unit emerged as technology advanced and the need for measuring lower frequencies became apparent, particularly in the fields of acoustics and signal processing.

### Example Calculation
To convert 5 Hz to millihertz, you would multiply by 1,000:
\[ 
5 \, \text{Hz} \times 1,000 = 5,000 \, \text{mHz} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Millihertz is particularly useful in applications where low-frequency measurements are crucial. For instance, it is often used in monitoring heart rates, analyzing seismic activity, and measuring the frequency of low-frequency sound waves.
