## Terahertz (THz) Frequency Converter Tool

### Definition
The terahertz (THz) is a unit of frequency that represents one trillion hertz (1 THz = 10^12 Hz). It lies in the electromagnetic spectrum between microwave and infrared radiation. Terahertz waves have gained significant attention in various fields, including telecommunications, imaging, and spectroscopy, due to their unique properties and applications.

### Standardization
The terahertz is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized for scientific and engineering purposes. It is commonly used in research and industry to measure frequencies in the terahertz range, which is crucial for understanding and manipulating electromagnetic waves.

### History and Evolution
The concept of terahertz frequencies emerged in the late 20th century, coinciding with advancements in technology that allowed for the generation and detection of these high-frequency waves. Initially, terahertz technology was limited to laboratory settings, but it has since evolved to find applications in various industries, including medical imaging, security screening, and wireless communication.

### Example Calculation
To convert terahertz to hertz, simply multiply the terahertz value by 10^12. For instance, if you have a frequency of 2 THz, the calculation would be:
\[ 
2 \, \text{THz} \times 10^{12} = 2 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Hz} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Terahertz frequencies are utilized in numerous applications, including:
- **Medical Imaging**: THz waves can penetrate biological tissues, making them useful for non-invasive imaging techniques.
