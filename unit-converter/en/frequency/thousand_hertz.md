## Thousand Hertz (kHz) Tool Description

### Definition
Thousand Hertz, commonly abbreviated as kHz, is a unit of frequency that represents one thousand cycles per second. It is widely used in various fields, including telecommunications, audio engineering, and electronics, to measure the frequency of sound waves, radio waves, and other periodic phenomena.

### Standardization
The kilohertz (kHz) is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized under the metric system. It is derived from the hertz (Hz), which is the base unit of frequency. One kilohertz equals 1,000 hertz, making it a convenient unit for expressing frequencies that are too large to be easily represented in hertz.

### History and Evolution
The concept of frequency has evolved significantly since the early days of physics. The term "hertz" was named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetic waves in the late 19th century. As technology advanced, the need for more practical units of frequency led to the adoption of the kilohertz, which became particularly important in the development of radio and audio technologies.

### Example Calculation
To convert a frequency from hertz to kilohertz, simply divide the number of hertz by 1,000. For example, if you have a frequency of 5,000 Hz, the conversion to kilohertz would be:

\[ 5,000 \, \text{Hz} \div 1,000 = 5 \, \text{kHz} \]

### Use of the Units
Kilohertz is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Audio frequencies (e.g., music and sound engineering)
- Radio frequencies (e.g., AM and FM broadcasting)
- Digital communications (e.g., data transmission rates)
