## Fuel Efficiency (Mass) Tool

### Definition
The Fuel Efficiency (Mass) tool is designed to help users convert and understand fuel efficiency metrics based on mass. It allows you to calculate how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel by measuring the distance traveled per unit of mass consumed. The primary base unit for this tool is kilometers per kilogram (km/kg), symbolized by ðŸš—. This tool is essential for anyone looking to optimize fuel consumption, whether for personal vehicles or commercial fleets.

### Standardization
Fuel efficiency metrics can vary widely across different regions and vehicle types. Standardization is crucial for accurate comparisons. This tool provides conversions across various units, including miles per kilogram, liters per 100 kilometers, and gallons per mile. By using standardized metrics, users can make informed decisions about their fuel consumption and environmental impact.

### History and Evolution
The concept of fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was measured simply in miles per gallon (MPG). However, as environmental concerns grew, more comprehensive metrics emerged, focusing on mass and distance. Today, the Fuel Efficiency (Mass) tool reflects this evolution, providing users with a versatile platform for understanding and optimizing fuel usage.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the Fuel Efficiency (Mass) tool, consider a vehicle that consumes 10 kilograms of fuel to travel 100 kilometers. The fuel efficiency can be calculated as follows:

- Fuel Efficiency = Distance / Mass Consumed
- Fuel Efficiency = 100 km / 10 kg = 10 km/kg

This means the vehicle travels 10 kilometers for every kilogram of fuel consumed.

### Use of the Units
Understanding the various units of fuel efficiency is crucial for effective usage. The tool provides conversions for:

- **Kilometers per Kilogram (km/kg)**: Ideal for measuring fuel efficiency in metric systems.
- **Miles per Gallon (mpg)**: Commonly used in the United States.
- **Liters per 100 Kilometers (L/100km)**: A standard metric used in many countries.
- **Grams per Kilometer (g/km)**: Useful for assessing emissions and environmental impact.
