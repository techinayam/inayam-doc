### Definition

Gallons per 100 miles is a measurement that indicates how many gallons of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel 100 miles. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the fuel efficiency of vehicles, allowing users to make informed decisions about their transportation options.

### Standardization

The use of gallons per 100 miles is standardized in the United States and is commonly used in the automotive industry. This metric provides a clear understanding of fuel consumption, making it easier to compare different vehicles and their efficiency ratings.

### History and Evolution

The concept of measuring fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was measured in miles per gallon (MPG), but as the need for more precise comparisons grew, the gallons per 100 miles metric emerged. This shift allows for a more straightforward understanding of fuel usage, especially for those looking to minimize their environmental impact.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how the gallons per 100 miles metric works, consider a vehicle that consumes 4 gallons of fuel to travel 100 miles. The calculation is straightforward:

- Fuel Consumption: 4 gallons
- Distance: 100 miles

Thus, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle is 4 gal/100mi. This means that for every 100 miles traveled, the vehicle uses 4 gallons of fuel.

### Use of the Units

The gallons per 100 miles unit is particularly useful for:

- Comparing fuel efficiency across different vehicles.
- Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of fuel consumption.
- Making informed decisions about vehicle purchases based on fuel efficiency.
