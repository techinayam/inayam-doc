### Definition

Gallons per mile (gal/mi) is a measurement that indicates how many gallons of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel one mile. This metric is crucial for understanding the efficiency of a vehicle, allowing users to compare different vehicles or driving styles effectively.

### Standardization

The standardization of fuel efficiency metrics, including gallons per mile, has been adopted by various automotive and environmental organizations. This standardization allows for consistent comparisons across different vehicles and helps consumers make informed choices when purchasing or operating a vehicle.

### History and Evolution

The concept of measuring fuel efficiency dates back to the early 20th century when automobiles became widely accessible. Over the years, as environmental concerns grew, the need for standardized measurements like gallons per mile emerged. Today, this metric is widely used in the automotive industry and by consumers alike to evaluate vehicle performance and environmental impact.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the gallons per mile metric, consider a vehicle that consumes 10 gallons of fuel to travel 100 miles. To calculate the fuel efficiency in gal/mi, you would divide the total gallons by the total miles:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Total Gallons}}{\text{Total Miles}} = \frac{10 \text{ gal}}{100 \text{ mi}} = 0.1 \text{ gal/mi} \]

### Use of the Units
