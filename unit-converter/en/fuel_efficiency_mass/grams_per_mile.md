## Grams per Mile (g/mi) Tool Description

### Definition
The grams per mile (g/mi) is a unit of measurement that quantifies fuel efficiency in terms of mass. It indicates how many grams of fuel are consumed for every mile traveled. This metric is crucial for evaluating the environmental impact of vehicles and understanding their fuel consumption patterns.

### Standardization
Grams per mile is part of the metric system and is widely used in the automotive industry to assess fuel efficiency. It provides a standardized way to compare different vehicles and their fuel consumption rates, making it easier for consumers to make informed decisions.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency dates back to the early 20th century when the automotive industry began to grow. As environmental concerns increased, the need for standardized measurements like grams per mile became essential. Over the years, this metric has evolved to include various testing methods and regulations, ensuring accurate and reliable data for consumers and manufacturers alike.

### Example Calculation
To calculate grams per mile, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Fuel Consumption (g/mi)} = \frac{\text{Total Fuel Used (grams)}}{\text{Total Distance Traveled (miles)}} \]

For instance, if a vehicle consumes 500 grams of fuel over a distance of 10 miles, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Fuel Consumption} = \frac{500 \text{ g}}{10 \text{ mi}} = 50 \text{ g/mi} \]

### Use of the Units
Understanding grams per mile is essential for consumers looking to reduce their fuel costs and environmental impact. It allows for easy comparisons between different vehicles, helping buyers make informed choices based on fuel efficiency.
