## Tool Description: Kilograms per 100 Kilometers (kg/100km)

The **Kilograms per 100 Kilometers (kg/100km)** unit is a standard measure used to evaluate fuel efficiency in vehicles, particularly in the automotive industry. It indicates the amount of fuel consumed (in kilograms) for every 100 kilometers traveled. This metric is essential for understanding vehicle performance, environmental impact, and cost efficiency, making it a valuable tool for both consumers and manufacturers.

### Definition

Kilograms per 100 kilometers (kg/100km) is a metric that quantifies fuel consumption. It provides a clear and standardized way to assess how much fuel a vehicle uses over a specific distance, allowing for easy comparisons between different vehicles and driving conditions.

### Standardization

The kg/100km metric is widely recognized and utilized in various regions, particularly in Europe. It aligns with international standards for measuring fuel efficiency, ensuring consistency and reliability in data reporting across the automotive industry.

### History and Evolution

The kg/100km measurement has evolved alongside advancements in automotive technology and environmental awareness. As fuel efficiency became a critical factor in vehicle design and consumer choice, this metric emerged as a standard for evaluating performance. Over the years, regulations and testing methods have been refined to provide more accurate representations of real-world fuel consumption.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the kg/100km metric, consider a vehicle that consumes 8 kg of fuel over a distance of 100 kilometers. This means the vehicle's fuel efficiency is 8 kg/100km. If you were to drive 250 kilometers, you would calculate the fuel consumption as follows:

- Fuel Consumption = (Distance / 100) × Fuel Efficiency
- Fuel Consumption = (250 / 100) × 8 = 20 kg

### Use of the Units

The kg/100km unit is particularly useful for:

- Comparing fuel efficiency across different vehicle models.
- Assessing the environmental impact of vehicles based on fuel consumption.
- Calculating fuel costs based on expected travel distances.
