## Kilometers per Gram (km/g) Tool Description

### Definition
The kilometers per gram (km/g) is a unit of measurement that expresses fuel efficiency in terms of distance traveled per unit of mass. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the fuel consumption of vehicles and machinery, allowing users to understand how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel relative to its weight.

### Standardization
Kilometers per gram is standardized within the metric system, where the kilometer (km) represents a distance of 1,000 meters, and the gram (g) is a unit of mass equal to one-thousandth of a kilogram. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in calculations, making it easier for users to compare fuel efficiencies across different vehicles or machinery.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was measured in terms of liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km) or miles per gallon (mpg). However, as the focus on sustainability and environmental impact increased, the need for more precise measurements like kilometers per gram emerged. This evolution reflects a growing awareness of the importance of fuel efficiency in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the kilometers per gram metric, consider a vehicle that travels 300 kilometers while consuming 15 grams of fuel. The calculation for fuel efficiency would be:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency (km/g)} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled (km)}}{\text{Fuel Consumed (g)}} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{15 \text{ g}} = 20 \text{ km/g} \]

This means the vehicle travels 20 kilometers for every gram of fuel consumed.

### Use of the Units
Kilometers per gram is primarily used in the automotive and transportation industries, where it helps manufacturers and consumers assess the efficiency of vehicles. It can also be applied in other fields, such as aviation and shipping, where understanding fuel consumption relative to weight is crucial for operational efficiency.
