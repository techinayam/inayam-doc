## Tool Description: Liters per 100 Kilometers (L/100km)

The **Liters per 100 Kilometers (L/100km)** is a widely used metric for measuring fuel efficiency in vehicles. It indicates the amount of fuel consumed (in liters) to travel a distance of 100 kilometers. This unit is particularly popular in countries that utilize the metric system, providing a clear understanding of a vehicle's fuel consumption and helping consumers make informed decisions when purchasing or evaluating vehicles.

### Definition
Liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) is a metric unit that quantifies fuel consumption. A lower L/100km value signifies better fuel efficiency, meaning the vehicle consumes less fuel for the same distance traveled.

### Standardization
The L/100km metric is standardized and widely accepted in many regions, including Europe and parts of Asia. It provides a consistent method for comparing the fuel efficiency of various vehicles, making it easier for consumers to assess their options.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency dates back to the early 20th century, with various methods employed to quantify fuel consumption. The L/100km metric gained popularity in the late 20th century as environmental awareness grew, prompting consumers to seek more fuel-efficient vehicles. Today, it is an essential part of vehicle specifications and environmental regulations.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the fuel efficiency of a vehicle in L/100km, use the following formula:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency (L/100km)} = \left( \frac{\text{Fuel Consumed (liters)}}{\text{Distance Traveled (km)}} \right) \times 100 \]

For example, if a vehicle consumes 8 liters of fuel to travel 100 kilometers, its fuel efficiency would be 8 L/100km.

### Use of the Units
Understanding L/100km is crucial for consumers looking to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact. By comparing vehicles based on this metric, users can make informed choices that align with their budget and sustainability goals.
