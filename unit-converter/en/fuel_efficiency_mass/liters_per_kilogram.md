## Liters per Kilogram (L/kg) Tool Description

### Definition
The liters per kilogram (L/kg) is a unit of measurement that expresses the volume of a substance in liters relative to its mass in kilograms. This metric is particularly useful in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering, where understanding the relationship between volume and mass is essential for accurate calculations and conversions.

### Standardization
The liters per kilogram unit is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) framework, allowing for consistent application across scientific disciplines. This standardization ensures that measurements are universally understood and can be reliably used in calculations.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring substances by both volume and mass dates back centuries, with significant advancements occurring during the development of the metric system in the late 18th century. The liters per kilogram unit has evolved alongside scientific understanding, becoming an integral part of modern scientific measurement.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of liters per kilogram, consider a substance with a density of 0.8 kg/L. To find the liters per kilogram, you would calculate:
\[ 
\text{Liters per Kilogram} = \frac{1}{\text{Density (kg/L)}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \, \text{L/kg} 
\]
This means that for every kilogram of the substance, there are 1.25 liters.

### Use of the Units
Liters per kilogram is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Fuel efficiency calculations in automotive engineering.
- Chemical formulations in laboratories.
- Food industry measurements for ingredient density.

### Usage Guide
