## Miles Per Gram (mi/g) Converter Tool

### Definition
The miles per gram (mi/g) is a unit of measurement that expresses fuel efficiency in terms of distance traveled per unit of mass. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the efficiency of vehicles and machinery that consume fuel, allowing users to understand how far they can travel with a specific amount of fuel mass.

### Standardization
Miles per gram is not a universally standardized unit, but it is commonly used in specific industries, particularly in automotive and aerospace sectors. The conversion between miles and grams can vary based on the type of fuel and its energy content. This tool helps standardize these conversions for easier comparison and analysis.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel efficiency was expressed in miles per gallon (mpg), which is still widely used today. However, as the focus on sustainability and fuel economy has increased, metrics like miles per gram have gained traction, providing a more precise measurement for various applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the miles per gram converter, consider a vehicle that travels 300 miles on 10 grams of fuel. The calculation would be:

\[ 
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ grams}} = 30 \text{ mi/g} 
\]

This means the vehicle achieves an efficiency of 30 miles per gram of fuel.

### Use of the Units
Miles per gram is particularly valuable in industries where fuel efficiency is a critical factor. It allows engineers, manufacturers, and consumers to compare the performance of different vehicles or machinery based on their fuel consumption. This metric can also assist in making informed decisions regarding fuel types and vehicle designs.
