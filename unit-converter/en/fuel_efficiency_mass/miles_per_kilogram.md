### Definition

Miles per kilogram (mi/kg) is a unit of measurement that expresses the distance traveled in miles for every kilogram of fuel consumed. This metric is vital for assessing the efficiency of vehicles and understanding fuel consumption rates.

### Standardization

The miles per kilogram unit is part of the broader metric system, which standardizes measurements to facilitate global communication and understanding. The use of mi/kg allows for consistent comparisons across different vehicles and fuel types, making it easier to analyze performance and efficiency.

### History and Evolution

The concept of measuring fuel efficiency dates back to the early 20th century when the automotive industry began to grow rapidly. As vehicles became more prevalent, the need for standardized measurements of fuel consumption emerged. The miles per kilogram metric evolved as a way to quantify fuel efficiency, allowing consumers and manufacturers to make informed decisions regarding vehicle performance.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the miles per kilogram converter, consider a vehicle that travels 300 miles on 10 kilograms of fuel. To calculate the fuel efficiency in mi/kg:

\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled (miles)}}{\text{Fuel Consumed (kg)}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ kg}} = 30 \text{ mi/kg} \]
