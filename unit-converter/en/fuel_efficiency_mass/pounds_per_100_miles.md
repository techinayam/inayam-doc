## Pounds per 100 Miles Tool Description

The **Pounds per 100 Miles** (lb/100mi) tool is an essential resource for individuals and businesses looking to calculate fuel efficiency in terms of mass. This unit of measurement provides a clear understanding of how much fuel is consumed over a distance of 100 miles, making it particularly useful for those in the automotive, logistics, and transportation sectors. 

### Definition

Pounds per 100 miles is a metric that quantifies the amount of fuel consumed (in pounds) for every 100 miles traveled. This measurement allows users to assess the efficiency of vehicles or transport methods, helping them make informed decisions regarding fuel consumption and environmental impact.

### Standardization

The lb/100mi unit is standardized within the United States and is commonly used in various industries, particularly in the automotive sector. It provides a consistent basis for comparing fuel efficiency across different vehicles and transport methods.

### History and Evolution

The concept of measuring fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was primarily measured in gallons per mile or miles per gallon (MPG). However, as environmental concerns grew and the need for more precise measurements emerged, the lb/100mi metric gained popularity. This evolution reflects a broader trend towards sustainability and efficiency in transportation.

### Example Calculation

To illustrate how to use the Pounds per 100 Miles tool, consider a vehicle that consumes 20 pounds of fuel to travel 100 miles. The calculation is straightforward:

- Fuel consumed: 20 lbs
- Distance: 100 miles
- Fuel efficiency: 20 lb/100mi

This means the vehicle consumes 20 pounds of fuel for every 100 miles traveled.
