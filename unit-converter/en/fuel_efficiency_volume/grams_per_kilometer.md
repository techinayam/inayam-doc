## Grams per Kilometer (g/km) Tool Description

### Definition
Grams per kilometer (g/km) is a unit of measurement that expresses the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by a vehicle for every kilometer it travels. This metric is crucial for understanding a vehicle's environmental impact and fuel efficiency, helping consumers make informed decisions when purchasing vehicles.

### Standardization
The g/km metric is standardized by various environmental agencies and organizations worldwide, including the European Union, which mandates that manufacturers report CO2 emissions in this format. This standardization ensures consistency and comparability across different vehicles and manufacturers.

### History and Evolution
The use of grams per kilometer as a measure of vehicle emissions emerged in the late 20th century as environmental concerns grew. Initially, fuel efficiency was primarily measured in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km), but as the focus shifted towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, g/km became the preferred unit of measurement. This evolution reflects a broader commitment to sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint of transportation.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate grams per kilometer, consider a vehicle that emits 120 grams of CO2 for every kilometer it travels. If this vehicle drives 100 kilometers, the total emissions would be:

\[ 
\text{Total Emissions} = \text{Emission Rate} \times \text{Distance} 
\]
\[ 
\text{Total Emissions} = 120 \, g/km \times 100 \, km = 12,000 \, grams \, (or \, 12 \, kg) 
\]

### Use of the Units
The grams per kilometer metric is widely used in the automotive industry, particularly in Europe, to inform consumers about a vehicle's environmental performance. It is also used by regulatory bodies to set emissions standards and by environmental organizations to promote cleaner transportation options.
