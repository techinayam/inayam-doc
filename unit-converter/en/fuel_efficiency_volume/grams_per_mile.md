## Grams per Mile (g/mi) Tool Description

### Definition
The grams per mile (g/mi) is a unit of measurement that quantifies fuel efficiency in terms of the mass of fuel consumed for every mile traveled. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the environmental impact of vehicles, as it provides insight into how much fuel is used relative to distance traveled.

### Standardization
Grams per mile is standardized within the metric system, where mass is measured in grams and distance in miles. This unit is commonly used in the automotive industry, particularly in regions where the imperial system is prevalent, making it essential for comparing vehicle efficiency across different markets.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency has evolved significantly over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was measured in gallons per mile or liters per 100 kilometers. However, as environmental awareness grew, the grams per mile metric emerged, allowing for a more precise understanding of fuel consumption in relation to emissions. This evolution reflects a broader trend towards sustainability and efficiency in transportation.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the grams per mile metric, consider a vehicle that consumes 20 grams of fuel to travel 1 mile. The calculation would be straightforward:

- Fuel consumed: 20 grams
- Distance traveled: 1 mile

Thus, the vehicle's fuel efficiency is 20 g/mi.

### Use of the Units
The grams per mile unit is primarily used in the automotive sector, especially for electric and hybrid vehicles. It helps manufacturers and consumers understand the efficiency of vehicles, enabling better decision-making regarding fuel consumption and environmental impact.
