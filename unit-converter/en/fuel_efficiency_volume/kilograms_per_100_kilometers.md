## Tool Description: Kilograms per 100 Kilometers (kg/100km)

The **Kilograms per 100 Kilometers (kg/100km)** is a vital metric used primarily in the automotive industry to measure fuel efficiency. This unit indicates how many kilograms of fuel a vehicle consumes to travel 100 kilometers. Understanding this metric is crucial for consumers, manufacturers, and environmentalists alike, as it directly relates to fuel economy and emissions.

### Definition
Kilograms per 100 kilometers (kg/100km) is a measurement that quantifies the amount of fuel consumed by a vehicle over a distance of 100 kilometers. It provides a clear indication of fuel efficiency, allowing users to compare different vehicles and their environmental impact.

### Standardization
The kg/100km metric is standardized across various regions, particularly in Europe, where it is commonly used in vehicle specifications. This standardization ensures consistency in reporting fuel consumption and allows for easier comparisons between different vehicles.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring fuel efficiency dates back to the early 20th century, with the introduction of the automobile. Over the decades, as environmental concerns grew, the focus on fuel efficiency intensified. The kg/100km metric emerged as a preferred standard due to its clarity and ease of understanding, helping consumers make informed decisions regarding fuel consumption.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to calculate fuel consumption in kg/100km, consider a vehicle that uses 8 liters of fuel to travel 100 kilometers. If the density of the fuel is approximately 0.75 kg/liter, the calculation would be as follows:

- Fuel consumed: 8 liters x 0.75 kg/liter = 6 kg
- Therefore, the vehicle's fuel efficiency is 6 kg/100km.

### Use of the Units
The kg/100km unit is widely used by manufacturers to advertise fuel efficiency, by consumers to compare vehicles, and by regulatory bodies to establish emissions standards. It serves as a critical metric for understanding a vehicle's environmental impact and operational costs.

### Usage Guide
To utilize the **Kilograms per 100 Kilometers** tool effectively, follow these steps:
1. **Input Data**: Enter the amount of fuel consumed (in liters) and the distance traveled (in kilometers).
2. **Select Fuel Type**: Choose the type of fuel to ensure accurate density conversion.
3. **Calculate**: Click the 'Calculate' button to obtain the fuel consumption in kg/100km.
4. **Interpret Results**: Review the output to understand the vehicle's fuel efficiency and compare it with other vehicles.

### Best Practices
- **Use Accurate Data**: Ensure that the fuel consumption and distance figures are accurate for the best results.
- **Compare Similar Vehicles**: When comparing fuel efficiencies, use vehicles within the same category for a fair assessment.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of changes in fuel types and their densities, as this can affect calculations.
- **Consider Environmental Impact**: Use the kg/100km metric not only to assess cost but also to understand the environmental implications of fuel consumption.
