## Tool Description: Liters per 100 Kilometers (L/100km)

The **Liters per 100 Kilometers (L/100km)** is a widely recognized metric used to measure fuel efficiency in vehicles. This unit indicates the amount of fuel consumed (in liters) for every 100 kilometers traveled. Understanding this metric is crucial for both consumers and manufacturers, as it directly relates to fuel costs and environmental impact.

### Definition

Liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km) is a standard unit of measurement that quantifies fuel consumption. It provides a clear picture of how efficiently a vehicle uses fuel, allowing users to compare different vehicles or driving habits.

### Standardization

L/100km is standardized across many countries, particularly in Europe and Canada, where it is commonly used in vehicle specifications and fuel economy ratings. This standardization helps consumers make informed decisions when purchasing vehicles or planning long-distance travel.

### History and Evolution

The use of L/100km as a fuel efficiency metric has evolved over the years. Initially, fuel consumption was often expressed in miles per gallon (MPG), particularly in the United States. However, as global awareness of environmental issues grew, the L/100km metric gained popularity due to its straightforward representation of fuel efficiency.

### Example Calculation

To calculate fuel consumption in L/100km, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Fuel Consumption (L/100km)} = \left( \frac{\text{Fuel Used (liters)}}{\text{Distance Traveled (km)}} \right) \times 100 \]

For example, if a vehicle uses 8 liters of fuel to travel 100 kilometers, its fuel efficiency would be 8 L/100km.

### Use of the Units

The L/100km metric is particularly useful for:

- Comparing the fuel efficiency of different vehicles.
- Estimating fuel costs for trips.
- Understanding the environmental impact of driving habits.
