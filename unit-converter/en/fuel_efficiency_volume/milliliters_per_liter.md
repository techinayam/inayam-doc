## Milliliters per Liter (mL/L) Tool Description

### Definition
Milliliters per liter (mL/L) is a unit of measurement that expresses the volume of a substance in milliliters relative to one liter of solution. This metric is crucial in various fields, including chemistry, biology, and environmental science, where precise measurements are essential for experiments and formulations.

### Standardization
The milliliter is a metric unit of volume equal to one-thousandth of a liter. The standardization of milliliters and liters is governed by the International System of Units (SI), ensuring consistency and accuracy in scientific measurements worldwide.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring liquid volumes dates back to ancient civilizations, but the metric system, including milliliters and liters, was officially adopted in France in the late 18th century. Since then, the metric system has evolved into a global standard, facilitating international trade and scientific collaboration.

### Example Calculation
To convert a volume measurement from milliliters to liters, simply divide the number of milliliters by 1,000. For instance, if you have 250 mL of a solution, the equivalent in liters would be:
\[ 
\text{Volume in Liters} = \frac{250 \, \text{mL}}{1000} = 0.25 \, \text{L} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Milliliters per liter is commonly used in various applications, such as calculating concentrations in solutions, determining fuel efficiency in vehicles, and measuring ingredients in cooking and baking. Understanding this unit is essential for professionals in fields like pharmacology, environmental science, and food technology.
