## Candela (cd) - Illuminance Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The candela (symbol: cd) is the SI unit of luminous intensity, representing the amount of light emitted by a source in a particular direction. It is a fundamental unit in photometry, which is the science of measuring visible light as perceived by the human eye. The candela is crucial for understanding how light interacts with our environment, making it essential for various applications in lighting design, photography, and visual arts.

### Standardization
The candela is standardized based on the light emitted by a source that radiates monochromatic light at a frequency of 540 terahertz (THz) and has a radiant intensity of 1/683 watt per steradian. This standardization ensures consistency in measurements across different contexts and applications, allowing professionals to rely on accurate and comparable data.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the candela has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially, it was based on the light produced by a specific type of candle. However, as science progressed, the need for a more precise and universally applicable unit became evident. The candela was officially adopted as part of the International System of Units (SI) in 1979, reflecting advancements in photometric measurements and technology.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the candela, consider a light source that emits a luminous intensity of 100 candelas. If you want to calculate the total luminous flux (in lumens) emitted by this source over a solid angle of 1 steradian, you would use the formula:
\[ \text{Luminous Flux (lm)} = \text{Intensity (cd)} \times \text{Solid Angle (sr)} \]
Thus, for our example:
\[ \text{Luminous Flux} = 100 \, \text{cd} \times 1 \, \text{sr} = 100 \, \text{lm} \]

### Use of the Units
The candela is widely used in various fields, including:
- **Lighting Design**: To specify the intensity of light fixtures.
- **Photography**: To determine the appropriate exposure settings.
- **Safety Regulations**: In ensuring adequate lighting in public spaces.
