## Footcandle (fc) Tool Description

### Definition
A footcandle (fc) is a unit of illuminance that quantifies the amount of light that falls on a surface. Specifically, one footcandle is defined as the illuminance produced by a uniform light source of one candela at a distance of one foot. This measurement is crucial in various fields, including photography, architecture, and horticulture, where precise lighting conditions are essential for optimal performance.

### Standardization
The footcandle is part of the Imperial system of measurement and is commonly used in the United States. It is standardized by the International System of Units (SI), which allows for consistent and reliable measurements across different applications. Understanding footcandles is vital for professionals who need to ensure adequate lighting in workspaces, classrooms, and public areas.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring light has evolved significantly since the early days of photography and film. The footcandle emerged as a practical unit in the early 20th century, providing a standardized way to discuss and measure light levels. Over time, advancements in lighting technology and a deeper understanding of human vision have led to more refined methods of measuring illuminance, including the use of lux, which is the metric equivalent of footcandles.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to convert footcandles to lux, consider a scenario where a room is illuminated with a light source that produces 50 footcandles. To convert this to lux, you can use the conversion factor: 1 footcandle = 10.764 lux. Therefore, 50 fc x 10.764 = 538.2 lux.

### Use of the Units
Footcandles are widely used in various industries, including:
- **Photography**: To determine the appropriate lighting for capturing images.
- **Architecture**: To design spaces with adequate lighting for safety and aesthetics.
- **Horticulture**: To measure light levels for optimal plant growth.
