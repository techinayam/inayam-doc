## Footcandle Hour (fc·h) Tool Description

### Definition
The footcandle hour (fc·h) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the total illuminance received over a specified period of time. It is derived from the footcandle, which measures the amount of light that falls on a surface from a light source. One footcandle is defined as the illuminance produced by one lumen per square foot. The footcandle hour, therefore, provides a comprehensive understanding of light exposure over time, making it essential for various applications in lighting design, photography, and horticulture.

### Standardization
The footcandle hour is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) and is widely used in the United States and other countries that follow the imperial system. It is crucial for professionals in fields such as architecture, agriculture, and photography to ensure consistent lighting conditions and optimize light usage.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring light exposure dates back to the early 20th century when scientists began to study the effects of light on human health and plant growth. The footcandle unit was established to provide a practical means of measuring light intensity in indoor and outdoor environments. Over the years, the footcandle hour has evolved into a vital tool for professionals who require precise control over lighting conditions.

### Example Calculation
To calculate footcandle hours, multiply the illuminance in footcandles by the duration in hours. For example, if a space is illuminated at 50 footcandles for 4 hours, the total light exposure would be:
\[ 
\text{Footcandle Hours} = 50 \, \text{fc} \times 4 \, \text{h} = 200 \, \text{fc·h} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Footcandle hours are particularly useful in various industries:
- **Agriculture**: To determine the light exposure for plants.
- **Photography**: To ensure optimal lighting conditions for capturing images.
- **Interior Design**: To create well-lit spaces that enhance aesthetics and functionality.
