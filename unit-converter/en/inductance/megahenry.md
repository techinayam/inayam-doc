## Megahenry (MH) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The megahenry (MH) is a unit of inductance in the International System of Units (SI). It is equivalent to one million henries (1 MH = 1,000,000 H). Inductance is a property of an electrical circuit that opposes changes in current, and it plays a crucial role in the functioning of inductors, transformers, and other electrical components.

### Standardization
The megahenry is standardized under the SI units, which ensures consistency and uniformity in measurements across various scientific and engineering applications. This standardization allows engineers and technicians to communicate effectively and accurately when dealing with inductance values.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century. Over time, as electrical engineering evolved, the need for standardized units became apparent. The henry was named after the American inventor Joseph Henry, and the megahenry emerged as a practical unit for larger inductance values, facilitating calculations in complex electrical systems.

### Example Calculation
To convert inductance from henries to megahenries, simply divide the value in henries by 1,000,000. For example, if you have an inductance of 2,500,000 H, the conversion to megahenries would be:

\[ 
2,500,000 \, H \div 1,000,000 = 2.5 \, MH 
\]

### Use of the Units
Megahenries are commonly used in high-power electrical applications, such as power transmission systems, electric motors, and inductive components in electronic circuits. Understanding and converting inductance values is essential for engineers and technicians working in these fields.
