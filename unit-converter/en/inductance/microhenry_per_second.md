## Microhenry per Second (µH/s) Tool Description

### Definition
Microhenry per second (µH/s) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the rate of change of inductance in an electrical circuit. It is a derived unit representing the change in inductance measured in microhenries (µH) over a time period of one second. This tool is essential for engineers and technicians working with inductors in various electronic applications, enabling precise calculations and conversions.

### Standardization
The microhenry is a standard unit in the International System of Units (SI), where one microhenry equals one-millionth of a henry. The standardization of inductance units helps ensure consistency and accuracy in electrical engineering calculations, making the µH/s a critical component in designing and analyzing circuits.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century, leading to the development of the henry as a unit of measurement. Over time, as technology advanced, smaller units like the microhenry emerged to accommodate the needs of modern electronics. The µH/s has become increasingly relevant with the rise of compact electronic devices, where precise inductance measurements are crucial for performance.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the microhenry per second, consider a scenario where an inductor's inductance changes from 10 µH to 20 µH over a period of 5 seconds. The rate of change in inductance can be calculated as follows:

Rate of Change = (Final Inductance - Initial Inductance) / Time  
Rate of Change = (20 µH - 10 µH) / 5 s = 2 µH/s

### Use of the Units
The microhenry per second is widely used in various applications, including:
- Designing filters and oscillators in communication systems.
- Analyzing transient responses in electrical circuits.
- Evaluating the performance of inductive components in power electronics.
