## Tool Description: Microhenry per Turn (µH/t) Converter

The **Microhenry per Turn (µH/t)** is a unit of measurement used to express inductance in electrical circuits, specifically in relation to the number of turns in a coil. This tool allows users to easily convert microhenries per turn into other inductance units, facilitating better understanding and application in various electrical engineering contexts.

### Definition
Microhenry per Turn (µH/t) quantifies the inductance of a coil per individual turn of wire. Inductance is the property of an electrical conductor that opposes changes in electric current, and it is critical in the design of inductors, transformers, and various electronic components.

### Standardization
The microhenry (µH) is a subunit of henry (H), the standard unit of inductance in the International System of Units (SI). One microhenry is equal to one-millionth of a henry. The standardization of inductance units ensures consistency across engineering and scientific applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century, laying the groundwork for modern electromagnetic theory. The microhenry unit emerged as technology advanced, allowing for more precise measurements in smaller inductive components, which became essential in the development of compact electronic devices.

### Example Calculation
For instance, if you have a coil with an inductance of 200 µH and it consists of 50 turns, the inductance per turn can be calculated as follows:
\[ 
\text{Inductance per Turn} = \frac{\text{Total Inductance (µH)}}{\text{Number of Turns}} = \frac{200 \, \mu H}{50} = 4 \, \mu H/t 
\]

### Use of the Units
Microhenry per Turn is particularly useful in applications involving inductors and transformers, where understanding the inductance relative to the number of turns is crucial for designing efficient circuits. This unit helps engineers optimize the performance of electrical components by allowing for precise calculations and adjustments.
