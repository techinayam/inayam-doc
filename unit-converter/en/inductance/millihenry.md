## Millihenry (mH) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The millihenry (mH) is a unit of inductance in the International System of Units (SI). It represents one-thousandth of a henry, the standard unit of inductance. Inductance is a property of an electrical circuit that opposes changes in current, making it a crucial concept in electrical engineering and physics.

### Standardization
The millihenry is standardized under the SI system, ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements across various applications. This standardization is vital for engineers and scientists who rely on precise calculations in their work.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century. The henry was named after the American scientist Joseph Henry, who made significant contributions to the field of electromagnetism. Over time, the millihenry emerged as a practical subunit, allowing for more manageable calculations in circuits where inductance values are often small.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the millihenry, consider a circuit with an inductor rated at 10 mH. If the current flowing through the inductor changes at a rate of 2 A/s, the induced voltage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = L \cdot \frac{di}{dt} \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the induced voltage (in volts),
- \( L \) is the inductance (in henries),
- \( \frac{di}{dt} \) is the rate of change of current (in amperes per second).

For our example:
\[ V = 10 \times 10^{-3} \cdot 2 = 0.02 \, \text{V} \]

### Use of the Units
Millihenries are commonly used in various applications, including:
- Electrical engineering for designing circuits,
- Telecommunications for signal processing,
- Power supply systems for energy storage.
