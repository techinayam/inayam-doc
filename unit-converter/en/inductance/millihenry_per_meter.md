## Millihenry per Meter (mH/m) Tool Description

### Definition
The millihenry per meter (mH/m) is a unit of inductance that measures the ability of a conductor to store energy in a magnetic field per unit length. It is commonly used in electrical engineering and physics to quantify the inductance of various components, such as coils and transformers, in relation to their physical dimensions.

### Standardization
The millihenry (mH) is a subunit of the henry (H), the standard unit of inductance in the International System of Units (SI). One millihenry is equal to one-thousandth of a henry (1 mH = 0.001 H). The standardization of inductance units allows for consistent measurements and comparisons across different applications and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced in the 19th century, with significant contributions from scientists like Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry. The millihenry became a practical unit as electrical engineering evolved, allowing for more precise calculations in circuit design and analysis. Over time, the use of inductance units has expanded into various fields, including telecommunications, power systems, and electronic device manufacturing.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of millihenry per meter, consider a coil with an inductance of 5 mH and a length of 2 meters. To calculate the inductance per meter, you would divide the total inductance by the length:

Inductance per meter = Total Inductance / Length  
Inductance per meter = 5 mH / 2 m = 2.5 mH/m

### Use of the Units
Millihenry per meter is particularly useful in applications involving transmission lines, inductive sensors, and RF circuits. Understanding the inductance per unit length helps engineers design more efficient systems by optimizing component placement and minimizing energy losses.
