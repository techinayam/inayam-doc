## Millihenry per Second (mH/s) Tool Description

### Definition
Millihenry per second (mH/s) is a unit of measurement that expresses the rate of change of inductance in electrical circuits. It is a subunit of henry, where 1 millihenry equals 0.001 henries. This measurement is crucial in understanding how inductors behave in alternating current (AC) circuits, especially in applications involving inductive reactance.

### Standardization
The millihenry per second is standardized under the International System of Units (SI). It is derived from the henry, which is the SI unit of inductance. The symbol for millihenry is mH, and when expressed per second, it indicates the rate at which the inductance changes over time.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century, and the unit was named after Joseph Henry, an American scientist who made significant contributions to the field of electromagnetism. Over time, as electrical engineering evolved, the need for smaller units like millihenry became apparent, allowing for more precise calculations in circuit design.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of millihenry per second, consider an inductor with an inductance of 10 mH. If the current through this inductor changes at a rate of 2 A/s, the induced electromotive force (EMF) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{EMF} = -L \frac{di}{dt} \]

Where:
- \( L \) is the inductance in henries (10 mH = 0.01 H)
- \( \frac{di}{dt} \) is the rate of change of current (2 A/s)

Thus, the induced EMF would be:

\[ \text{EMF} = -0.01 \times 2 = -0.02 \text{ V} \]

### Use of the Units
Millihenry per second is commonly used in electrical engineering, particularly in the design and analysis of inductors in circuits. It helps engineers and technicians understand how inductors will respond to changes in current, which is essential for ensuring the stability and efficiency of electrical systems.
