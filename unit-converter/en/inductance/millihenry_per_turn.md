## Millihenry per Turn (mH/t) Tool Description

### Definition
Millihenry per turn (mH/t) is a unit of inductance that quantifies the inductance of a coil based on the number of turns it contains. Inductance is a fundamental property in electrical engineering, representing the ability of a conductor to store energy in a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it. The millihenry (mH) is a subunit of henry, where 1 millihenry equals one-thousandth of a henry.

### Standardization
The millihenry per turn is standardized within the International System of Units (SI). It is crucial for engineers and technicians to use standardized units to ensure consistency and accuracy in electrical calculations and designs.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century through his experiments with electromagnetic induction. Over time, the unit of inductance evolved, leading to the adoption of the henry as the standard unit. The millihenry emerged as a practical subunit, allowing for more manageable calculations in smaller inductive components.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of millihenry per turn, consider a coil with an inductance of 10 mH and 5 turns. The inductance per turn can be calculated as follows:

Inductance per turn (mH/t) = Total inductance (mH) / Number of turns  
Inductance per turn (mH/t) = 10 mH / 5 turns = 2 mH/t

### Use of the Units
Millihenry per turn is commonly used in the design and analysis of inductors, transformers, and other electromagnetic devices. Understanding this unit is essential for electrical engineers and technicians who work with circuits and electromagnetic systems.
