## Nanohenry (nH) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The nanohenry (nH) is a unit of inductance in the International System of Units (SI). It is equivalent to one billionth of a henry (1 nH = 10^-9 H). Inductance is a property of an electrical conductor that quantifies the ability to store energy in a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it. The nanohenry is commonly used in various electrical engineering applications, particularly in the design of inductors and transformers in high-frequency circuits.

### Standardization
The nanohenry is standardized under the SI units, which ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across various scientific and engineering disciplines. This standardization is crucial for engineers and technicians who require precise calculations in their work.

### History and Evolution
The concept of inductance was first introduced by Michael Faraday in the 19th century, leading to the establishment of the henry as the standard unit of inductance. As technology advanced, particularly in the field of electronics, smaller inductance values became necessary, resulting in the adoption of subunits such as the nanohenry. This evolution reflects the growing demand for precision in modern electronic devices.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the nanohenry, consider an inductor with an inductance of 10 nH. If the current flowing through the inductor is 5 A, the energy stored in the magnetic field can be calculated using the formula:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 \]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy in joules,
- \( L \) is the inductance in henries,
- \( I \) is the current in amperes.

Substituting the values:

\[ E = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 10^{-9} \times (5)^2 = 1.25 \times 10^{-8} \text{ joules} \]

### Use of the Units
The nanohenry is particularly useful in high-frequency applications such as RF (radio frequency) circuits, where inductors with very low inductance values are required. It is also used in the design of filters, oscillators, and other electronic components.
