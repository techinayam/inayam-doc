## Micrometer (µm) Tool Description

### Definition
A micrometer, symbolized as µm, is a unit of length in the metric system, equivalent to one-millionth of a meter. It is commonly used in scientific and engineering contexts to measure small distances or thicknesses with high precision. The micrometer is particularly significant in fields such as physics, engineering, and manufacturing, where accurate measurements are crucial.

### Standardization
The micrometer is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements globally. This ensures that when you measure in micrometers, the value is universally understood and accepted, facilitating communication and collaboration across various scientific and industrial disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The term "micrometer" was first introduced in the early 19th century, derived from the Greek words "micros," meaning small, and "metron," meaning measure. Initially, micrometers were mechanical devices used for measuring small distances. Over time, advancements in technology have led to the development of digital micrometers, which provide even greater accuracy and ease of use.

### Example Calculation
To convert 100 micrometers to millimeters, you would divide by 1,000, as there are 1,000 micrometers in a millimeter:
\[ 
100 \, \text{µm} = \frac{100}{1000} \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{mm} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Micrometers are widely used in various applications, including:
- **Manufacturing**: To measure the thickness of materials, such as metal sheets or coatings.
- **Biology**: To measure the size of microorganisms or cells.
- **Engineering**: To ensure precision in the dimensions of mechanical parts.
