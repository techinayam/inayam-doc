## Millimeter (mm) Unit Converter

### Definition
The millimeter (mm) is a metric unit of length that is equal to one-thousandth of a meter. It is widely used in various fields, including engineering, manufacturing, and everyday measurements, due to its precision and ease of use. The millimeter is particularly useful when dealing with small dimensions, making it an essential unit in industries such as construction and design.

### Standardization
The millimeter is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements across the globe. This ensures that the millimeter is universally recognized and utilized, facilitating accurate communication and data exchange in scientific and technical fields.

### History and Evolution
The millimeter has its roots in the metric system, which was developed in France during the late 18th century. The metric system was designed to provide a universal standard for measurements, and the millimeter was introduced as a subdivision of the meter. Over the years, the millimeter has gained popularity due to its practicality and precision, becoming a standard unit in many applications.

### Example Calculation
To convert 100 millimeters to centimeters, you can use the following formula: 
\[ 
\text{Centimeters} = \text{Millimeters} \div 10 
\]
So, 
\[ 
100 \text{ mm} \div 10 = 10 \text{ cm} 
\]
