## Nanometer (nm) Converter Tool

### Definition
A nanometer (nm) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one billionth of a meter (1 nm = 10^-9 m). This incredibly small measurement is commonly used in fields such as physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology, where precision is crucial. The nanometer is particularly significant when discussing the size of atoms and molecules, as well as in the development of materials at the nanoscale.

### Standardization
The nanometer is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized internationally. It is widely accepted and used across scientific disciplines, ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements. The symbol for nanometer is "nm," making it easily recognizable in scientific literature and applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the nanometer emerged in the late 20th century as advancements in technology allowed scientists to explore and manipulate materials at the atomic level. The term "nanotechnology" was coined in 1974 by physicist Eric Drexler, highlighting the importance of the nanometer scale in the development of new materials and devices. Since then, the use of nanometers has expanded significantly, influencing various industries, including electronics, medicine, and materials science.

### Example Calculation
To convert nanometers to meters, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Length in meters} = \text{Length in nanometers} \times 10^{-9} \]

For example, if you have a length of 500 nanometers, the conversion to meters would be:

\[ 500 \, \text{nm} = 500 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 5.0 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \]
