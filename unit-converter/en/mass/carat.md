## Carat Conversion Tool

### Definition
The carat (symbol: ct) is a unit of mass used primarily for measuring gemstones and pearls. One carat is equivalent to 200 milligrams (0.2 grams). This unit is crucial in the jewelry industry, where the weight of a gemstone significantly influences its value and pricing.

### Standardization
The carat is standardized internationally, ensuring consistency in the trade of precious stones. The metric system defines one carat as exactly 200 milligrams, making it a reliable unit for jewelers and consumers alike. This standardization helps prevent discrepancies in weight measurement, which can affect the pricing of gemstones.

### History and Evolution
The term "carat" originates from the carob seeds that were historically used as a balance scale for weighing gemstones. Over time, the carat evolved into a standardized unit, with the modern definition established in the early 20th century. The adoption of the metric system further solidified its use, making it a universal standard in the gemstone market.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion of carats to grams, consider a gemstone weighing 3 carats. To convert this weight into grams, you would use the following calculation:

\[ 
\text{Weight in grams} = \text{Weight in carats} \times 0.2 
\]

So, for a 3-carat gemstone:

\[ 
3 \, \text{ct} \times 0.2 \, \text{g/ct} = 0.6 \, \text{g} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Carats are predominantly used in the jewelry industry to measure the weight of diamonds and other precious stones. Understanding carat weight is essential for consumers when purchasing gemstones, as it directly impacts value and desirability.
