## Grain Converter Tool

### Definition
The grain (symbol: gr) is a unit of mass that is primarily used in the measurement of precious metals, gunpowder, and other small quantities. One grain is equivalent to approximately 64.79891 milligrams. This unit is particularly useful in fields where precision is crucial, such as in pharmaceuticals and metallurgy.

### Standardization
The grain has been standardized internationally, ensuring consistency in measurements across various applications. It is part of the avoirdupois system, which is widely used in the United States and other countries. Understanding the grain's standardization is essential for accurate conversions, especially when dealing with international standards.

### History and Evolution
The grain has a rich history that dates back to ancient civilizations. It was originally defined as the weight of a single grain of barley or wheat. Over time, the grain evolved into a standardized unit of mass used in various industries. Its historical significance is evident in its continued use today, particularly in the fields of science and commerce.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion from grains to grams, consider the following example: 
If you have 100 grains and want to convert them to grams, the calculation would be:
100 grains Ã— 0.06479891 grams/grain = 6.479891 grams.

### Use of the Units
Grains are commonly used in the following applications:
