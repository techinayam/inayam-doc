### Definition
Mass is a fundamental property of matter that quantifies the amount of substance in an object. It is commonly measured in various units, including kilograms (kg), grams (g), and tonnes (t). The symbol for mass is ⚖️. Understanding mass is crucial in fields ranging from science and engineering to everyday life.

### Standardization
The International System of Units (SI) standardizes mass measurement, with the kilogram as the base unit. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy across different applications, whether in scientific research or daily transactions.

### History and Evolution
The concept of mass has evolved significantly over time. Ancient civilizations used various methods to measure mass, often relying on physical objects as reference points. The modern definition of mass, based on the kilogram, was established in the late 18th century and has undergone refinements to ensure precision in measurement.
