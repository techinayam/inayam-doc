## Milligram Converter Tool

### Definition
A milligram (mg) is a unit of mass in the metric system, equivalent to one-thousandth of a gram. It is widely used in various fields, including medicine, nutrition, and chemistry, to measure small quantities of substances. Understanding milligrams is crucial for accurate dosing in pharmaceuticals and nutritional information.

### Standardization
The milligram is part of the International System of Units (SI), which standardizes measurements globally. Its symbol, "mg," is universally recognized, ensuring consistency in scientific communication. The milligram is defined based on the kilogram, where 1 milligram equals 0.000001 kilograms.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring mass dates back to ancient civilizations, but the metric system was formally adopted in the late 18th century. The milligram emerged as a practical unit for measuring small weights, particularly in the fields of medicine and chemistry. Over time, it has become an essential part of scientific research and everyday life.

### Example Calculation
To convert grams to milligrams, simply multiply the number of grams by 1,000. For instance, if you have 0.5 grams of a substance, the conversion to milligrams would be:
\[ 
0.5 \text{ grams} \times 1000 = 500 \text{ mg} 
\]
