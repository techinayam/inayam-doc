## Erg Per Second (erg/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The erg per second (erg/s) is a unit of power in the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system, representing the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. One erg is equivalent to \(10^{-7}\) joules, making the erg/s a useful measurement in various scientific fields, particularly in physics and engineering.

### Standardization
The erg/s is standardized within the CGS system, which is often used in scientific literature. While the International System of Units (SI) prefers watts (W) as the primary unit of power, understanding erg/s is essential for researchers and professionals working with CGS measurements.

### History and Evolution
The concept of energy and power has evolved significantly since the introduction of the erg by the physicist Julius von Mayer in the 19th century. The erg was developed as part of the CGS system to provide a more manageable scale for measuring small quantities of energy, especially in fields like thermodynamics and electromagnetism.

### Example Calculation
To convert power from watts to erg/s, you can use the following formula:
\[ 
1 \text{ W} = 10^7 \text{ erg/s} 
\]
For instance, if you have a power output of 5 watts, the equivalent in erg/s would be:
\[ 
5 \text{ W} \times 10^7 = 5 \times 10^7 \text{ erg/s} 
\]

### Use of the Units
The erg/s is commonly used in scientific research, particularly in fields such as astrophysics, where energy outputs can be extremely small. Understanding this unit allows researchers to communicate findings effectively, especially when dealing with phenomena that involve minute energy changes.
