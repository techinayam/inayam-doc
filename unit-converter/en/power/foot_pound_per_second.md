## Foot-Pound Per Second (ft·lb/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The foot-pound per second (ft·lb/s) is a unit of power that quantifies the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Specifically, it measures the amount of energy expended when one foot-pound of work is performed in one second. This unit is commonly used in various engineering and physics applications, particularly in the fields of mechanics and energy conversion.

### Standardization
The foot-pound per second is part of the Imperial system of units, where it is primarily used in the United States. It is defined based on the foot, a unit of length, and the pound, a unit of force. The standardization of this unit allows for consistent calculations and comparisons across various applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of power has been around since the early days of mechanics, but the specific use of foot-pounds as a measure of work dates back to the 19th century. The unit was popularized by engineers and scientists who needed a practical way to express power in terms of familiar measurements. Over time, the foot-pound per second has remained relevant, especially in industries such as automotive engineering and construction.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the foot-pound per second, consider a scenario where a motor does 100 foot-pounds of work in 5 seconds. The power output can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Power (ft·lb/s)} = \frac{\text{Work (ft·lb)}}{\text{Time (s)}} \]

\[ \text{Power} = \frac{100 \text{ ft·lb}}{5 \text{ s}} = 20 \text{ ft·lb/s} \]

### Use of the Units
The foot-pound per second is particularly useful in mechanical contexts, such as calculating the power output of engines, motors, and other machinery. It helps engineers and technicians assess the efficiency and performance of various systems.
