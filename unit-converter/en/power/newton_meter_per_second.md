## Newton Meter per Second (N·m/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The Newton Meter per Second (N·m/s) is a unit of power in the International System of Units (SI). It quantifies the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Specifically, one Newton Meter per Second is equivalent to one watt (W), making it a vital measurement in various fields such as physics, engineering, and mechanics.

### Standardization
The Newton Meter per Second is standardized under the SI units, where:
- **1 N·m/s = 1 W**
This standardization ensures consistency across scientific and engineering disciplines, allowing for accurate calculations and comparisons.

### History and Evolution
The concept of power has evolved significantly since the early days of physics. The term "watt" was named after James Watt, who made significant contributions to the development of the steam engine in the 18th century. The Newton Meter per Second emerged as a practical unit to express power in mechanical systems, facilitating advancements in engineering and technology.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the Newton Meter per Second in calculations, consider a scenario where a force of 10 Newtons is applied over a distance of 5 meters in 2 seconds. The power can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Power (P)} = \frac{\text{Work (W)}}{\text{Time (t)}} \]

Where Work (W) = Force (F) × Distance (d):

\[ W = 10 \, \text{N} \times 5 \, \text{m} = 50 \, \text{J} \]

Then, substituting into the power formula:

\[ P = \frac{50 \, \text{J}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 25 \, \text{W} \]

Thus, the power output is 25 N·m/s.

### Use of the Units
The Newton Meter per Second is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Mechanical engineering to assess the performance of engines and machines.
- Electrical engineering to measure the power output of electrical devices.
- Physics experiments to calculate energy transfer in dynamic systems.
