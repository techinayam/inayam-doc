## Byte Converter Tool

### Definition
A byte (symbol: B) is a fundamental unit of digital information storage and processing. It typically consists of 8 bits, which are the smallest units of data in computing. Bytes are used to represent a wide range of data types, including characters, numbers, and multimedia content, making them essential in the realm of information technology.

### Standardization
Bytes are standardized under the International System of Units (SI) and are widely recognized in both binary and decimal systems. In computing, the binary prefix is often used, where 1 kilobyte (KB) equals 1,024 bytes, while in the decimal system, 1 kilobyte equals 1,000 bytes. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for accurate data measurement and conversion.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the byte emerged in the early days of computing, with its roots tracing back to the 1950s. Initially, bytes were used to represent single characters in text. As technology advanced, the byte evolved to accommodate more complex data types, including images, audio, and video. Today, bytes are integral to data storage, transmission, and processing across various platforms and devices.

### Example Calculation
To convert bytes to kilobytes, you can use the following formula:
- **Kilobytes (KB) = Bytes (B) / 1,024**

For example, if you have 2,048 bytes:
- **2,048 B / 1,024 = 2 KB**

### Use of the Units
Bytes are commonly used in various applications, such as:
- Measuring file sizes (e.g., documents, images, videos)
- Determining memory and storage capacities (e.g., RAM, hard drives)
- Assessing data transfer rates (e.g., internet speed)
