## Tebibit per Second (Tibps) Tool Description

### Definition
The tebibit per second (Tibps) is a unit of measurement used to quantify data transfer rates in computing and telecommunications. It represents the speed at which data is transmitted or processed, specifically in tebibits, where one tebibit equals 2^40 bits. This unit is particularly relevant in contexts involving large data sets, such as cloud computing and data centers.

### Standardization
The tebibit per second is part of the binary prefix system standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This system provides a clear and consistent way to express data sizes and transfer rates, ensuring that users can accurately interpret and compare values across different platforms and technologies.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring data transfer rates has evolved significantly since the early days of computing. Initially, data was measured in bits and bytes, but as technology advanced and data sizes grew, the need for larger units became apparent. The introduction of binary prefixes, including tebibit, allowed for more precise measurements in the digital age, facilitating better communication and understanding among IT professionals.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of tebibit per second, consider a scenario where a server is capable of transferring data at a rate of 10 Tibps. This means that in one second, the server can transmit approximately 1.4 trillion bytes of data (10 Tibps x 2^40 bits). This high-speed transfer is essential for applications such as video streaming and large-scale data processing.

### Use of the Units
