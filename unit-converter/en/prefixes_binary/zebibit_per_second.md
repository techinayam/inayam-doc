## Zebibit Per Second (Zibps) Tool Description

### Definition
The zebibit per second (Zibps) is a unit of measurement used to quantify data transfer rates in binary systems. It represents the transfer of data at a rate of one zebibit per second, where a zebibit is equivalent to 2^70 bits. This unit is particularly relevant in fields such as computer science, telecommunications, and data storage, where high-speed data transfer is critical.

### Standardization
The zebibit per second is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It falls under the binary prefixes that are used to denote multiples of bytes and bits, providing a clear and consistent way to express large quantities of data.

### History and Evolution
The concept of binary prefixes was introduced in the late 20th century to address the growing need for standardized units in computing. As data storage and transfer rates increased, the need for larger units became apparent. The zebibit was officially recognized in 2005, allowing for more precise measurements in high-capacity data environments.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the zebibit per second, consider a scenario where a network can transfer data at a rate of 1 Zibps. This means that in one second, the network can transfer 2^70 bits of data, which is approximately 144,115,188,075,855,872 bits or 16,384 terabytes.

### Use of the Units
Zibps is predominantly used in high-performance computing, data centers, and telecommunications. It allows engineers and IT professionals to measure and compare data transfer rates effectively, ensuring optimal performance in data-intensive applications.
