## Millimeter of Water (mmH₂O) Tool Description

### Definition
The millimeter of water (mmH₂O) is a unit of pressure defined as the pressure exerted by a column of water exactly 1 millimeter high at standard gravity. It is commonly used in various fields, including engineering, meteorology, and fluid mechanics, to measure low pressures, particularly in applications involving water or other fluids.

### Standardization
The millimeter of water is part of the metric system and is standardized to ensure consistency across scientific and engineering applications. It is often used in conjunction with other pressure units such as pascal (Pa) and bar, allowing for easy conversion and comparison.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring pressure using a column of liquid dates back to the work of Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. The millimeter of water has evolved as a practical unit for measuring pressure in various industries, especially where low-pressure measurements are critical, such as in HVAC systems and laboratory settings.

### Example Calculation
To convert a pressure reading from millimeters of water to pascals, you can use the following formula:
\[ 
1 \, \text{mmH₂O} = 9.80665 \, \text{Pa} 
\]
For example, if you have a pressure of 100 mmH₂O, the equivalent pressure in pascals would be:
\[ 
100 \, \text{mmH₂O} \times 9.80665 \, \text{Pa/mmH₂O} = 980.665 \, \text{Pa} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Millimeters of water are widely used in various applications, including:
- Measuring pressure in HVAC systems
- Monitoring water levels in reservoirs
- Assessing fluid dynamics in engineering projects
- Conducting scientific experiments requiring precise pressure measurements
