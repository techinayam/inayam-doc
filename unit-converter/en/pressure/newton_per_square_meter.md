## Newton per Square Meter (N/m²) Tool Description

### Definition
The Newton per square meter (N/m²), commonly referred to as a Pascal (Pa), is the SI unit of pressure. It quantifies the amount of force applied per unit area, making it a crucial measurement in various scientific and engineering applications. Understanding pressure in N/m² is essential for fields such as physics, engineering, and meteorology.

### Standardization
The Newton per square meter is standardized by the International System of Units (SI). One Pascal is defined as one Newton of force applied over an area of one square meter. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across different disciplines and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of pressure has been studied for centuries, with early contributions from scientists like Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. The Pascal unit was officially adopted in 1971 as part of the SI system, named in honor of Pascal's significant contributions to fluid mechanics and pressure measurement.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of Newton per square meter, consider a scenario where a force of 100 Newtons is applied to an area of 2 square meters. The pressure can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Pressure (Pa)} = \frac{\text{Force (N)}}{\text{Area (m²)}} \]

Thus, 

\[ \text{Pressure} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{2 \, \text{m²}} = 50 \, \text{N/m²} \]

### Use of the Units
The Newton per square meter is widely used in various applications, including:
- Engineering calculations for structural integrity.
- Meteorological data to measure atmospheric pressure.
- Hydraulic systems to determine fluid pressure.
