## Torr Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The Torr is a unit of pressure defined as 1/760 of an atmosphere, equivalent to the pressure exerted by a 1 mm column of mercury at the Earth's gravity. It is commonly used in various scientific fields, particularly in physics and engineering, to measure low pressures.

### Standardization
The Torr is standardized based on the International System of Units (SI) and is widely accepted in scientific literature. It is often used in conjunction with other pressure units such as pascals and bars, making it essential for accurate pressure conversions.

### History and Evolution
The Torr was named after the Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli, who invented the barometer in the 17th century. This unit has evolved over time, gaining acceptance in various scientific disciplines due to its practicality in measuring atmospheric pressure and vacuum conditions.

### Example Calculation
To convert 1 Torr to pascals, use the following formula:
1 Torr = 133.322 Pa

For example, if you have a pressure measurement of 760 Torr, the conversion to pascals would be:
760 Torr x 133.322 Pa/Torr = 101325.0 Pa

### Use of the Units
The Torr is particularly useful in applications involving vacuum technology, meteorology, and laboratory experiments. It allows scientists and engineers to communicate pressure measurements effectively across different systems and disciplines.
