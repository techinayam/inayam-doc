## Alpha Particles Tool Description

### Definition
Alpha particles (symbol: Î±) are a type of ionizing radiation consisting of two protons and two neutrons, essentially making them identical to helium nuclei. They are emitted during the radioactive decay of heavy elements, such as uranium and radium. Understanding alpha particles is crucial in fields such as nuclear physics, radiation therapy, and environmental science.

### Standardization
Alpha particles are standardized in terms of their energy and intensity, which can be measured in units such as electronvolts (eV) or joules (J). The International System of Units (SI) does not have a specific unit for alpha particles, but their effects can be quantified using units of radioactivity, such as becquerels (Bq) or curies (Ci).

### History and Evolution
The discovery of alpha particles dates back to the early 20th century when Ernest Rutherford conducted experiments that led to the identification of these particles as a form of radiation. Over the years, research has expanded our understanding of alpha particles, their properties, and their applications in various scientific fields.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the alpha particles tool, consider a scenario where you need to convert the activity of a radioactive source from curies to becquerels. If you have a source with an activity of 1 Ci, the conversion would be as follows:

1 Ci = 37,000,000 Bq

Thus, 1 Ci of alpha radiation corresponds to 37 million disintegrations per second.

### Use of the Units
Alpha particles are primarily used in radiation therapy for cancer treatment, in smoke detectors, and in various scientific research applications. Understanding the measurement and conversion of alpha particle emissions is essential for professionals working in health physics, environmental monitoring, and nuclear engineering.
