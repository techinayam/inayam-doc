## Counts Per Minute (CPM) Tool Description

### Definition
Counts Per Minute (CPM) is a unit of measurement that quantifies the number of occurrences of a specific event in a minute. It is commonly used in fields such as radioactivity, where it measures the rate of decay of radioactive materials, and in various scientific and industrial applications. Understanding CPM is crucial for accurate data analysis and effective decision-making.

### Standardization
CPM is a standardized unit that allows for consistent measurement across different contexts. By using this unit, professionals can compare data from various sources and ensure that their findings are reliable and valid. The symbol for Counts Per Minute is "cpm," which is widely recognized in scientific literature and industry standards.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring events per minute has evolved significantly over the years. Initially used in the field of physics to measure radioactivity, CPM has expanded its applications to include various scientific, medical, and industrial fields. The development of advanced counting technologies has further refined the accuracy and reliability of CPM measurements.

### Example Calculation
To calculate CPM, one can use the following formula:

\[ \text{CPM} = \frac{\text{Total Counts}}{\text{Total Time in Minutes}} \]

For example, if a Geiger counter detects 300 counts in 5 minutes, the CPM would be:

\[ \text{CPM} = \frac{300 \text{ counts}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 60 \text{ cpm} \]

### Use of the Units
CPM is used in various applications, including:
- Monitoring radiation levels in nuclear facilities.
- Assessing the effectiveness of radiation therapy in medical settings.
- Evaluating the performance of industrial processes that involve counting events over time.
