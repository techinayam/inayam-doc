## Counts Per Second (CPS) Tool Description

### Definition
Counts per second (CPS) is a unit of measurement used to quantify the rate of radioactive decay or the number of events occurring in a given time frame. It is particularly relevant in fields such as nuclear physics, radiology, and health physics, where understanding the rate of decay is crucial for safety and regulatory compliance.

### Standardization
CPS is standardized within the International System of Units (SI) as a measure of radioactivity. It is essential for researchers and professionals to use standardized units to ensure consistency and comparability across studies and applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring radioactivity dates back to the early 20th century with the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and further research by Marie Curie. Over the years, the need for accurate measurement of radioactive decay led to the development of various units, including CPS, which has become a standard in measuring radioactivity.

### Example Calculation
To convert counts per minute (CPM) to counts per second (CPS), simply divide the CPM value by 60. For instance, if a detector registers 300 CPM, the CPS would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{CPS} = \frac{300 \text{ CPM}}{60} = 5 \text{ CPS} \]

### Use of the Units
CPS is widely used in various applications, including:
- Monitoring radiation levels in medical facilities
- Assessing environmental radiation
- Conducting research in nuclear physics
- Ensuring safety in nuclear power plants
