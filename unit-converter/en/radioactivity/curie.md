## Curie (Ci) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The **Curie (Ci)** is a unit of radioactivity that quantifies the amount of radioactive material. It is defined as the activity of a quantity of radioactive material in which one atom decays per second. This unit is crucial in fields such as nuclear medicine, radiology, and radiation safety, where understanding the level of radioactivity is essential for safety and treatment protocols.

### Standardization
The Curie is standardized based on the decay of radium-226, which was historically used as a reference point. One Curie is equivalent to 3.7 × 10^10 disintegrations per second. This standardization allows for consistent measurements across various applications, ensuring that professionals can accurately assess and compare levels of radioactivity.

### History and Evolution
The term "Curie" was named in honor of Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie, who conducted pioneering research in radioactivity in the early 20th century. The unit was established in 1910 and has since been widely adopted in scientific and medical fields. Over the years, the Curie has evolved alongside advancements in nuclear science, leading to the development of additional units such as the Becquerel (Bq), which is now commonly used in many applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the Curie, consider a sample of radioactive iodine-131 with an activity of 5 Ci. This means that the sample undergoes 5 × 3.7 × 10^10 disintegrations per second, which is approximately 1.85 × 10^11 disintegrations. Understanding this measurement is vital for determining dosage in medical treatments.

### Use of the Units
The Curie is primarily used in medical applications, such as determining the dosage of radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment, as well as in nuclear power generation and radiation safety assessments. It helps professionals monitor and manage exposure to radioactive materials, ensuring safety for both patients and healthcare providers.
