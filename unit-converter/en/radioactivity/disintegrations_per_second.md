## Disintegrations Per Second (dps) Tool Description

### Definition
Disintegrations per second (dps) is a unit of measurement used to quantify the rate at which radioactive atoms decay or disintegrate. This metric is crucial in fields such as nuclear physics, radiology, and environmental science, where understanding the rate of decay can have significant implications for safety and health.

### Standardization
The disintegration rate is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) and is often used alongside other units of radioactivity, such as becquerels (Bq) and curies (Ci). One disintegration per second is equivalent to one becquerel, making dps a vital unit in the study of radioactivity.

### History and Evolution
The concept of radioactivity was first discovered by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and the term "disintegration" was introduced to describe the process of radioactive decay. Over the years, advancements in technology have allowed for more precise measurements of disintegration rates, leading to the development of tools that can calculate dps with ease.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of dps, consider a sample of a radioactive isotope that has a decay constant (λ) of 0.693 per year. If you have 1 gram of this isotope, you can calculate the number of disintegrations per second using the formula:

\[ dps = N \times \lambda \]

Where:
- N = number of atoms in the sample
- λ = decay constant

Assuming there are approximately \(2.56 \times 10^{24}\) atoms in 1 gram of the isotope, the calculation would yield:

\[ dps = 2.56 \times 10^{24} \times 0.693 \]

This results in a specific disintegration rate, which can be crucial for safety assessments in nuclear applications.

### Use of the Units
Disintegrations per second is widely used in various applications, including:
- Medical diagnostics and treatments involving radioactive isotopes.
- Environmental monitoring of radioactive contamination.
- Research in nuclear physics and radiochemistry.
