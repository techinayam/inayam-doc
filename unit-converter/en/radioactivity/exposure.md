## Exposure Tool: Understanding Radioactivity Measurement

### Definition
Exposure, measured in coulombs per kilogram (C/kg), refers to the amount of ionizing radiation that is absorbed by air. It is a crucial metric in the field of radiology and nuclear physics, as it helps quantify the exposure of individuals and environments to radiation. Understanding exposure is vital for ensuring safety standards and regulatory compliance in various industries, including healthcare and nuclear energy.

### Standardization
The unit of exposure (C/kg) is standardized internationally, ensuring consistency in measurement across different regions and applications. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provide guidelines for measuring exposure, ensuring that professionals can accurately assess and manage radiation risks.

### History and Evolution
The concept of exposure has evolved significantly since the early 20th century when the dangers of radiation exposure became apparent. Initially, exposure was measured using rudimentary methods, but advancements in technology have led to the development of sophisticated instruments that provide precise measurements. Today, exposure is a critical parameter in radiation safety protocols, helping to protect workers and the public from harmful radiation levels.

### Example Calculation
To calculate exposure, one can use the formula:
\[ \text{Exposure (C/kg)} = \frac{\text{Charge (C)}}{\text{Mass of air (kg)}} \]

For example, if a radiation source emits a charge of 0.1 C in 1 kg of air, the exposure would be:
\[ \text{Exposure} = \frac{0.1 \text{ C}}{1 \text{ kg}} = 0.1 \text{ C/kg} \]

### Use of the Units
Exposure is primarily used in fields such as medical imaging, radiation therapy, and nuclear safety. It helps professionals assess the potential risks associated with radiation exposure and implement appropriate safety measures. Understanding exposure levels is essential for maintaining health and safety standards in environments where radiation is present.
