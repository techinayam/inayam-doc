## Half-Life Tool Description

### Definition
The half-life (symbol: tÂ½) is a fundamental concept in radioactivity and nuclear physics, representing the time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. This measurement is crucial for understanding the stability and longevity of radioactive materials, making it a key factor in fields such as nuclear medicine, environmental science, and radiometric dating.

### Standardization
The half-life is standardized across various isotopes, with each isotope having a unique half-life. For instance, Carbon-14 has a half-life of approximately 5,730 years, while Uranium-238 has a half-life of about 4.5 billion years. This standardization allows scientists and researchers to compare the decay rates of different isotopes effectively.

### History and Evolution
The concept of half-life was first introduced in the early 20th century as scientists began to understand the nature of radioactive decay. The term has evolved, and today it is widely used in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, and biology. The ability to calculate half-life has revolutionized our understanding of radioactive substances and their applications.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the remaining quantity of a radioactive substance after a certain number of half-lives, you can use the formula:

\[ N = N_0 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \]

Where:
- \( N \) = remaining quantity
- \( N_0 \) = initial quantity
- \( n \) = number of half-lives elapsed

For example, if you start with 100 grams of a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 3 years, after 6 years (which is 2 half-lives), the remaining quantity would be:

\[ N = 100 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 100 \times \frac{1}{4} = 25 \text{ grams} \]

### Use of the Units
The half-life is widely used in various applications, including:
- **Nuclear Medicine**: Determining the dosage and timing of radioactive tracers.
- **Environmental Science**: Assessing the decay of pollutants in ecosystems.
- **Archaeology**: Using carbon dating to estimate the age of organic materials.
