## milliGray (mGy) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
The milliGray (mGy) is a unit of measurement used to quantify absorbed radiation dose. It is a subunit of the Gray (Gy), which is the SI unit for measuring the amount of radiation energy absorbed per kilogram of matter. One milliGray is equal to one-thousandth of a Gray (1 mGy = 0.001 Gy). This unit is crucial in fields such as radiology, nuclear medicine, and radiation safety, where understanding the effects of radiation exposure is essential.

### Standardization
The milliGray is standardized by the International System of Units (SI) and is widely recognized in scientific literature and regulatory frameworks. It provides a consistent measure for comparing radiation doses across different contexts, ensuring that health professionals can make informed decisions regarding patient safety and treatment protocols.

### History and Evolution
The Gray was introduced in 1975 by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) as a standard unit for radiation dose. The milliGray emerged as a practical subunit to allow for more manageable figures when dealing with lower doses of radiation, which are often encountered in medical imaging and therapeutic applications.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of milliGray, consider a patient undergoing a CT scan that delivers a dose of 10 mGy. This means that the patient has absorbed 10 milliGrays of radiation, which can be compared to other procedures or previous exposures to assess cumulative radiation dose.

### Use of the Units
The milliGray is commonly used in medical settings, particularly in radiology and oncology, to monitor and manage radiation exposure. It helps healthcare professionals assess the risks associated with diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy, ensuring that the benefits outweigh potential harm.
