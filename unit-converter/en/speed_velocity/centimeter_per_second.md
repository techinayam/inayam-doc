## Centimeter per Second (cm/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The centimeter per second (cm/s) is a unit of speed that measures the distance traveled in centimeters over a period of one second. This metric is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and everyday life, to express the velocity of objects in a more manageable scale than meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h).

### Standardization
The centimeter per second is part of the metric system, which is standardized by the International System of Units (SI). One centimeter is equal to 0.01 meters, making it a convenient unit for measuring smaller distances, particularly in scientific contexts.

### History and Evolution
The centimeter was introduced in the late 18th century as part of the metric system, which aimed to provide a universal standard for measurement. Over the years, the centimeter per second has evolved to become a common unit in various scientific disciplines, enabling precise calculations and comparisons.

### Example Calculation
To convert a speed of 100 cm/s to meters per second, you can use the following formula:
\[ 
\text{Speed in m/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in cm/s}}{100} 
\]
Thus, 100 cm/s equals 1 m/s.

### Use of the Units
The centimeter per second is particularly useful in contexts where small distances and rapid movements are involved, such as in laboratory experiments, robotics, and certain sports. It allows for a detailed understanding of speed without the need for larger, less precise units.
