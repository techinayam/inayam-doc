## Light Speed Converter Tool

### Definition
The light speed, denoted by the symbol **c**, is a fundamental constant in physics that represents the speed at which light travels in a vacuum. This speed is approximately **299,792,458 meters per second** (m/s). Understanding light speed is crucial for various scientific calculations, especially in fields such as astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and relativity.

### Standardization
Light speed is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) and serves as a critical reference point for measuring other speeds. The speed of light is universally accepted and is a cornerstone of modern physics, influencing theories and calculations across multiple disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of light speed has evolved significantly over the centuries. Early theories proposed that light traveled instantaneously, but experiments in the 19th century, such as those conducted by Albert Michelson, provided the first accurate measurements. The establishment of light speed as a constant by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity marked a pivotal moment in our understanding of the universe, demonstrating that nothing can exceed this speed.

### Example Calculation
To convert light speed into kilometers per hour (km/h), you can use the following formula:

\[ c \, (m/s) \times 3.6 = c \, (km/h) \]

For instance, if you have the speed of light in meters per second:

\[ 299,792,458 \, m/s \times 3.6 \approx 1,079,252,848.8 \, km/h \]

This calculation illustrates the immense speed at which light travels, emphasizing its significance in scientific studies.

### Use of the Units
