## Meter per Second (m/s) Unit Converter

### Definition
The meter per second (m/s) is the SI (International System of Units) derived unit of speed. It measures the distance traveled in meters within one second. This unit is widely used in scientific contexts, engineering, and everyday applications where speed is a critical factor.

### Standardization
The meter per second is standardized by the International System of Units (SI). It is defined based on the meter, which is the fundamental unit of length, and the second, which is the fundamental unit of time. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in measurements across various fields.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring speed dates back to ancient civilizations, but the formalization of the meter and second occurred in the late 18th century during the French Revolution. The meter was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator, while the second was based on the Earth's rotation. Over time, these definitions have evolved, leading to the current SI units we use today.

### Example Calculation
To convert speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s), you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{\text{Speed (km/h)}}{3.6} \]

For example, if a vehicle is traveling at 90 km/h:
\[ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{90}{3.6} \approx 25 \text{ m/s} \]

### Use of the Units
The meter per second is commonly used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and transportation. It is essential for calculating velocities in mechanics, analyzing fluid dynamics, and determining the speed of vehicles and aircraft.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**1. What is the difference between meters per second and kilometers per hour?**  
Meters per second (m/s) measures speed in terms of distance traveled in meters over one second, while kilometers per hour (km/h) measures speed in kilometers traveled over one hour. To convert between the two, divide the km/h value by 3.6.

**2. How do I convert 100 miles to kilometers?**  
To convert 100 miles to kilometers, multiply by 1.60934. Therefore, 100 miles is approximately 160.934 kilometers.

**3. What is the standard unit for measuring speed in physics?**  
The standard unit for measuring speed in physics is the meter per second (m/s), as it is part of the International System of Units (SI).

**4. Can I use the meter per second converter for other speed units?**  
Yes, the meter per second converter can be used to convert between various speed units, including kilometers per hour, miles per hour, and feet per second.

**5. How can I calculate the date difference using this tool?**  
While the meter per second converter is specifically for speed, you can use other tools on our website, such as the date difference calculator, to find the duration between two dates.
