## Mile Per Hour (mph) Tool Description

### Definition
The mile per hour (mph) is a unit of speed commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It measures the distance traveled in miles over the span of one hour. This unit is particularly relevant for road travel, allowing drivers to gauge their speed and comply with speed limits.

### Standardization
The mile per hour is standardized based on the international mile, which is defined as exactly 1,609.344 meters. This unit is widely recognized and used in various applications, particularly in transportation and automotive industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring speed in miles per hour has its roots in the early days of road travel. The mile itself has a rich history, originating from the Roman "mille passus," or thousand paces. Over time, as vehicles evolved, the need for a standardized speed measurement became essential, leading to the adoption of mph as a common unit.

### Example Calculation
To convert miles per hour to kilometers per hour, you can use the conversion factor: 1 mph is approximately equal to 1.60934 km/h. For example, if you are traveling at 60 mph, the equivalent speed in kilometers per hour would be:

\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 1.60934 = 96.5604 \text{ km/h} \]

### Use of the Units
Mile per hour is predominantly used in contexts such as road signs, vehicle speedometers, and racing. Understanding this unit is crucial for drivers to ensure safety and compliance with traffic regulations.
