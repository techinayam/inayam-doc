## Spacecraft Velocity Tool Description

### Definition
The **Spacecraft Velocity (SV)** tool is designed to help users convert and understand the speed of spacecraft in various units. Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position. In the context of spacecraft, it is crucial for mission planning, navigation, and understanding the dynamics of space travel.

### Standardization
Spacecraft velocity is typically measured in several standard units, including kilometers per hour (km/h), meters per second (m/s), and miles per hour (mph). This tool allows users to convert between these units seamlessly, ensuring that calculations are accurate and standardized across different systems.

### History and Evolution
The concept of velocity has evolved significantly since the dawn of space exploration. Early missions relied on basic calculations, but as technology advanced, so did the methods for measuring and converting velocity. Today, spacecraft velocity is a critical factor in mission design, trajectory analysis, and performance evaluation.

### Example Calculation
For instance, if a spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 30,000 km/h, users can easily convert this to meters per second using the spacecraft velocity tool. The conversion is done by dividing the speed in kilometers per hour by 3.6, resulting in approximately 8,333.33 m/s.

### Use of the Units
Understanding spacecraft velocity is essential for various applications, including:
- Launch trajectory planning
- Orbital mechanics
- Interplanetary travel
- Spacecraft docking procedures
