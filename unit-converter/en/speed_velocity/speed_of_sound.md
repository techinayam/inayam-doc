## Speed of Sound Converter Tool

### Definition
The speed of sound refers to the distance that sound waves can travel in a given medium over a specific period. It is typically measured in meters per second (M/s) and varies based on factors such as temperature, pressure, and the medium through which the sound is traveling. Understanding the speed of sound is crucial in various fields, including acoustics, aviation, and meteorology.

### Standardization
The speed of sound is standardized under specific conditions, primarily at sea level in dry air at 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), where it is approximately 343 meters per second (M/s). This standardization allows for consistent calculations and comparisons across different scientific and engineering applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the speed of sound has evolved significantly since the time of early scientists like Galileo and Newton. In the 17th century, Galileo first attempted to measure the speed of sound, but it wasn't until the 19th century that more accurate measurements were made. Today, advancements in technology and research have allowed for precise calculations and applications of the speed of sound in various fields.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the speed of sound converter, consider the following example: If the speed of sound in air is 343 M/s, and you want to convert this speed into kilometers per hour (km/h), you can use the conversion factor (1 M/s = 3.6 km/h). Therefore, 343 M/s is equivalent to approximately 1234.8 km/h.

### Use of the Units
The speed of sound is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Aerospace Engineering**: Understanding how sound behaves at different altitudes and speeds.
- **Acoustics**: Designing spaces for optimal sound quality.
- **Meteorology**: Analyzing how sound travels in different atmospheric conditions.
