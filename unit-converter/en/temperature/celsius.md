## Celsius Temperature Converter Tool

### Definition
The Celsius (°C) is a temperature scale used to measure thermal energy. It is one of the most widely used temperature scales in the world, particularly in scientific contexts and in most countries outside the United States. The Celsius scale is based on the freezing point of water at 0°C and the boiling point at 100°C under standard atmospheric conditions.

### Standardization
The Celsius scale is standardized by the International System of Units (SI) and is defined by the Kelvin scale, where 0°C is equivalent to 273.15 K. This relationship allows for easy conversions between Celsius and Kelvin, making it essential for scientific calculations and applications.

### History and Evolution
The Celsius scale was developed by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius in 1742. Originally, it was defined with the freezing point of water at 100 degrees and the boiling point at 0 degrees. However, this was later reversed to the current definition we use today. Over the years, the Celsius scale has become the standard for temperature measurement in most countries, particularly in Europe and Asia.

### Example Calculation
To convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C), you can use the formula:
\[ 
°C = (°F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} 
\]
For example, to convert 68°F to Celsius:
\[ 
°C = (68 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} = 20°C 
\]

### Use of the Units
Celsius is widely used in various fields, including meteorology, cooking, and scientific research. It is essential for understanding weather forecasts, cooking temperatures, and laboratory experiments.
