## Centigrade (°C) Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
Centigrade, commonly referred to as Celsius (°C), is a temperature scale used to measure thermal energy. It is defined such that 0 °C is the freezing point of water and 100 °C is the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. This scale is widely adopted in scientific contexts and everyday life, making it essential for various applications.

### Standardization
The Celsius scale is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The scale is based on the properties of water, making it intuitive and practical for everyday use. The Celsius scale is often used in conjunction with the Kelvin scale, where 0 °C is equivalent to 273.15 K.

### History and Evolution
The Celsius scale was developed in 1742 by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius. Initially, it was defined with the freezing point of water at 100 °C and the boiling point at 0 °C. However, this was later reversed to the current definition we use today. The Celsius scale has undergone various adaptations and is now universally recognized, making it a cornerstone of temperature measurement.

### Example Calculation
To convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C), you can use the formula:
\[ °C = (°F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} \]

For example, to convert 68 °F to Celsius:
\[ °C = (68 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} = 20 °C \]

### Use of the Units
Celsius is predominantly used in most countries around the world for everyday temperature measurements, including weather forecasts, cooking, and scientific research. It is essential for anyone needing to understand temperature variations in a global context.
