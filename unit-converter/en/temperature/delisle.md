## Delisle Temperature Converter Tool

### Definition
The Delisle scale, denoted by the symbol °D, is a temperature scale that is primarily used in specific scientific contexts. It is an inverse scale, meaning that as the temperature increases, the Delisle value decreases. This unique characteristic makes it distinct from more commonly used temperature scales like Celsius or Fahrenheit.

### Standardization
The Delisle scale is not as widely adopted as other temperature scales, but it is standardized in scientific literature. The conversion from Delisle to Celsius is given by the formula:  
\[ °C = 100 - °D \]  
This formula allows users to easily convert Delisle values into Celsius, facilitating better understanding and application in various scientific fields.

### History and Evolution
The Delisle scale was developed in the 18th century by the French physicist Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. Initially, it was used for measuring temperatures in thermometers, particularly in meteorology. Over time, other temperature scales gained popularity, leading to a decline in the use of the Delisle scale. However, it remains relevant in certain scientific discussions and calculations.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to convert Delisle to Celsius, consider a temperature of 50 °D. Using the conversion formula:  
\[ °C = 100 - 50 = 50 °C \]  
This example demonstrates how straightforward it is to use the Delisle scale with our converter tool.

### Use of the Units
The Delisle scale is primarily used in scientific research and discussions where historical context or specific applications require its use. While it may not be common in everyday life, understanding this scale can be beneficial for students and professionals in fields like physics and meteorology.
