## Dew Point Converter Tool

### Definition
The dew point is a critical measurement in meteorology and HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) that indicates the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture. When air cools to its dew point, water vapor condenses into liquid water, forming dew. This measurement is essential for understanding humidity levels and predicting weather patterns.

### Standardization
The dew point is typically expressed in degrees Celsius (°C) and is standardized across various scientific and engineering fields. This standardization allows for consistent communication and understanding of humidity-related phenomena.

### History and Evolution
The concept of dew point has been utilized for centuries, with early meteorologists observing the relationship between temperature and humidity. As technology advanced, more precise instruments were developed to measure dew point, leading to improved weather forecasting and climate studies.

### Example Calculation
To calculate the dew point, you can use the following formula:

\[ 
Dew Point (°C) = T - \left(\frac{100 - RH}{5}\right) 
\]

Where:
- T = Current temperature in °C
- RH = Relative Humidity in percentage

For instance, if the temperature is 25°C and the relative humidity is 60%, the dew point would be:

\[ 
Dew Point = 25 - \left(\frac{100 - 60}{5}\right) = 25 - 8 = 17°C 
\]

### Use of the Units
Understanding dew point is vital for various applications, including weather forecasting, agriculture, and HVAC system design. It helps in assessing comfort levels, predicting condensation, and ensuring optimal conditions for various processes.
