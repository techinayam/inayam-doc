## Fahrenheit Temperature Converter Tool

### Definition
The Fahrenheit (°F) is a temperature scale commonly used in the United States and a few other countries. It defines the freezing point of water at 32°F and the boiling point at 212°F under standard atmospheric conditions. This scale is particularly useful for everyday temperature measurements, such as weather forecasts and cooking.

### Standardization
The Fahrenheit scale is standardized based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which are critical reference points for various applications. This standardization allows for consistent temperature readings across different contexts, making it easier for users to understand and communicate temperature data.

### History and Evolution
The Fahrenheit scale was developed in the early 18th century by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. Initially, he established the scale using three reference points: the freezing point of a brine solution, the freezing point of water, and the average human body temperature. Over time, the scale has evolved, but its primary use remains in the United States, while most of the world has adopted the Celsius scale.

### Example Calculation
To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you can use the formula:
\[ C = \frac{(F - 32) \times 5}{9} \]
For example, if you want to convert 68°F to Celsius:
\[ C = \frac{(68 - 32) \times 5}{9} = 20°C \]

### Use of the Units
Fahrenheit is predominantly used in the United States for weather reporting, cooking, and heating systems. Understanding how to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa is essential for travelers and professionals working in international contexts.
