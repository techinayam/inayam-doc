## Golden Mean Temperature Converter Tool

### Definition
The Golden Mean Temperature, represented in degrees Celsius (°C), is a unique temperature scale that is derived from the principles of the golden ratio. It serves as a fascinating intersection of mathematics and science, allowing users to explore temperature conversions in a way that is both intuitive and engaging.

### Standardization
The Golden Mean Temperature is not a standard unit of measurement like Celsius or Fahrenheit; rather, it is a conceptual tool that can help users understand temperature relationships through the lens of the golden ratio. This innovative approach allows for a deeper appreciation of temperature variations and their implications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and environmental science.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the golden ratio dates back to ancient Greece and has been utilized in various disciplines, including art, architecture, and nature. The integration of this mathematical principle into temperature measurement is a modern development that reflects the ongoing evolution of scientific thought and the quest for deeper understanding in the natural world.

### Example Calculation
To convert a temperature from Celsius to Golden Mean Temperature, you can use the formula:
\[ \text{Golden Mean Temperature} = \text{Celsius} \times \frac{1.618}{1} \]
For example, if you have a temperature of 20°C, the calculation would be:
\[ 20°C \times 1.618 = 32.36 \text{ Golden Mean Temperature} \]
