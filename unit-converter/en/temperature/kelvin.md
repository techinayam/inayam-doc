## Kelvin Temperature Converter Tool

### Definition
The Kelvin (K) is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). It is widely used in scientific contexts, particularly in physics and engineering, to measure thermodynamic temperature. Unlike other temperature scales, the Kelvin scale does not use degrees; instead, it is an absolute scale that starts at absolute zero, the point where all molecular motion ceases.

### Standardization
The Kelvin scale is standardized based on the properties of water. Specifically, one Kelvin is equivalent to one degree Celsius, but the Kelvin scale begins at absolute zero (0 K), which is equivalent to -273.15°C. This standardization allows for consistent temperature measurements across various scientific disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The Kelvin scale was named after the Scottish physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who contributed significantly to the field of thermodynamics in the 19th century. The scale was established in the mid-1800s and has since become a fundamental aspect of scientific research and education, enabling precise temperature measurements in various applications.

### Example Calculation
To convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, you can use the formula:
\[ K = °C + 273.15 \]
For instance, if you have a temperature of 25°C, the conversion to Kelvin would be:
\[ K = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 K \]

### Use of the Units
Kelvin is essential in scientific calculations, particularly in fields such as thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and astrophysics. It is used to express temperatures in various scientific experiments and is crucial for calculations involving gas laws, thermal energy, and other physical phenomena.
