## Century Converter Tool

### Definition
A century is a unit of time that represents a period of 100 years. The symbol for a century is "cent." This unit is widely used in historical contexts, scientific research, and various fields where long time spans are analyzed. Understanding how to convert centuries into other time units, such as years, decades, or even millennia, is essential for accurate historical analysis and data interpretation.

### Standardization
The concept of a century is standardized globally, with the Gregorian calendar being the most widely used calendar system. A century begins with a year ending in "00" and concludes with a year ending in "99." For instance, the 20th century spans from the year 1900 to 1999.

### History and Evolution
The term "century" has its roots in the Latin word "centum," meaning one hundred. The use of centuries as a time measurement has evolved over centuries, particularly in the context of historical documentation. Scholars and historians often refer to events in terms of centuries to provide a clearer understanding of the timeline and context.

### Example Calculation
To convert centuries to years, simply multiply the number of centuries by 100. For example, 2 centuries would equal 200 years (2 x 100 = 200). Conversely, to convert years to centuries, divide the number of years by 100. For instance, 250 years would be 2.5 centuries (250 รท 100 = 2.5).

### Use of the Units
Centuries are commonly used in various fields, including history, archaeology, and astronomy. They help in categorizing historical events, understanding trends over time, and analyzing data that spans long periods. For example, when discussing the Industrial Revolution, historians often refer to the 18th and 19th centuries to contextualize the changes that occurred.
