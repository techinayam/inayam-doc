## Fortnight Unit Converter Tool

### Definition
A fortnight is a unit of time equivalent to fourteen days, or two weeks. The term is derived from the Old English phrase "fēowertīene niht," which means "fourteen nights." This unit is commonly used in various contexts, including scheduling, project management, and historical references.

### Standardization
The fortnight is not a standard SI unit but is widely recognized in various English-speaking countries. It is often used in legal, agricultural, and cultural contexts, providing a convenient way to express periods of two weeks.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring time in fortnights dates back to ancient societies that relied on lunar cycles. The two-week period aligns well with the phases of the moon, making it a practical choice for early calendars. Over time, the fortnight has remained relevant, particularly in British English, where it is frequently used in everyday language.

### Example Calculation
To convert weeks into fortnights, simply divide the number of weeks by 2. For instance, if you have 6 weeks, the calculation would be:
\[ 
6 \text{ weeks} \div 2 = 3 \text{ fortnights} 
\]
