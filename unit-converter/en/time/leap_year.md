## Leap Year Tool: Your Ultimate Guide to Understanding Leap Years

### Definition
A leap year is a year that contains an additional day, February 29th, making it 366 days long instead of the standard 365 days. This adjustment is necessary to keep our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun. The leap year occurs every four years, with some exceptions based on specific rules.

### Standardization
The Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar system most widely used today, standardizes the leap year. According to this system, a year is considered a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4.
- It is not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

This means that while the year 2000 was a leap year, the year 1900 was not.

### History and Evolution
The concept of leap years dates back to ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Romans, who recognized the need to correct the calendar. The Julian calendar introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC included a leap year every four years. However, it was the Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, that refined the leap year rules to improve accuracy.

### Example Calculation
To determine if a specific year is a leap year, follow these steps:
1. Check if the year is divisible by 4.
2. If it is, check if it is divisible by 100.
3. If it is divisible by 100, check if it is also divisible by 400.

For instance, the year 2024 is divisible by 4, not by 100, making it a leap year. Conversely, the year 2100 is divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400, so it is not a leap year.

Understanding leap years is crucial for various applications, including:
