## Time Conversion Tool

### Definition
The Time Conversion Tool is designed to help users convert various time units seamlessly. Whether you need to convert seconds to hours or days to weeks, this tool simplifies the process, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The base unit for this tool is the second (⏰), which serves as the fundamental measure for all time-related conversions.

### Standardization
Time is universally standardized, allowing for consistent measurements across different contexts. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as the base unit of time, which is derived from the vibrations of cesium atoms. This standardization ensures that time measurements are precise and universally understood, making conversions between units like minutes, hours, and days straightforward.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring time dates back to ancient civilizations, where sundials and water clocks were used. Over centuries, timekeeping evolved with the invention of mechanical clocks and, eventually, atomic clocks. Today, the second is defined based on the vibrations of cesium atoms, a testament to our advancements in technology and understanding of time.

### Example Calculation
For instance, if you want to convert 100 seconds into minutes, you would divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). Thus, 100 seconds equals approximately 1.67 minutes. This tool allows users to perform such calculations effortlessly.

### Use of the Units
The Time Conversion Tool encompasses a wide range of time units, including:
- **Seconds**: The base unit of time.
- **Minutes**: 60 seconds.
- **Hours**: 60 minutes.
- **Days**: 24 hours.
- **Weeks**: 7 days.
- **Months**: Varies (28 to 31 days).
- **Years**: 365 days (or 366 in a leap year).
- **Microseconds, Milliseconds, Fortnight, Decade, Century, Nanosecond, Picosecond**: Smaller or larger subdivisions of time.
