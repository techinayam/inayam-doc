## Year Conversion Tool

### Definition
The year, symbolized as "yr," is a unit of time that represents the duration it takes for the Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun. This period is approximately 365.25 days, which is why we have a leap year every four years to account for the extra quarter of a day. Understanding how to convert years into other time units is essential for various applications, from scientific calculations to everyday planning.

### Standardization
The year is standardized in the Gregorian calendar, which is the most widely used civil calendar today. It is divided into 12 months, with varying lengths, and is crucial for timekeeping in both personal and professional contexts. The conversion of years into other time units, such as days, months, or even seconds, is essential for accurate time management and scheduling.

### History and Evolution
The concept of a year has evolved significantly over time. Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, developed their own calendars based on lunar cycles. The introduction of the Julian calendar by Julius Caesar in 45 BC was a significant advancement, which was later refined into the Gregorian calendar by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. This evolution reflects humanity's ongoing quest for precise timekeeping.

### Example Calculation
To convert 5 years into days:
- 1 year = 365.25 days (accounting for leap years)
- 5 years = 5 x 365.25 = 1826.25 days
