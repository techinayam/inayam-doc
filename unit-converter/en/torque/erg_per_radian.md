## Erg per Radian Converter Tool

### Definition
The erg per radian (erg/rad) is a unit of torque that measures the rotational force applied to an object. Torque is a crucial concept in physics and engineering, as it determines how effectively a force can cause an object to rotate around an axis. The erg itself is a unit of energy in the centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system, where one erg is equivalent to 10^-7 joules.

### Standardization
The erg/radian is part of the CGS system, which is widely used in scientific contexts, especially in fields like physics and engineering. While the International System of Units (SI) has largely replaced the CGS system in many applications, understanding erg/radian remains essential for specific calculations and conversions, particularly in academic and research settings.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has been around since the early days of mechanics, with the term "torque" itself derived from the Latin word "torquere," meaning "to twist." The erg was introduced in the late 19th century as part of the CGS system, allowing scientists to quantify energy in a more granular way. Over time, the erg/radian has become a standard unit for measuring torque in various scientific disciplines.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the erg/radian converter, consider a scenario where a force of 10 ergs is applied at a distance of 2 centimeters from the pivot point. The torque can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Torque} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance} \]
\[ \text{Torque} = 10 \, \text{ergs} \times 2 \, \text{cm} = 20 \, \text{erg-cm} \]

### Use of the Units
The erg/radian is particularly useful in fields such as mechanical engineering, physics, and materials science, where precise measurements of torque are necessary for designing and analyzing systems involving rotational motion. Understanding this unit allows professionals to communicate effectively about forces and their effects on objects.
