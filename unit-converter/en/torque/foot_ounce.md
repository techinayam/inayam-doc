## Foot Ounce (ft·oz) Converter Tool

### Definition
The foot ounce (ft·oz) is a unit of torque that combines the measurement of force applied at a distance. Specifically, it represents the amount of force (in ounces) applied at a distance of one foot from a pivot point. This unit is commonly used in various engineering and mechanical applications where torque is a critical factor.

### Standardization
The foot ounce is part of the imperial system of measurement, which is widely used in the United States and some other countries. It is essential to understand that torque can also be expressed in other units such as pound-feet (lb·ft) or newton-meters (N·m). Standardization of these units ensures that calculations and conversions between different systems remain consistent and accurate.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque dates back to the early days of mechanics, where engineers and scientists sought to understand the effects of force applied at a distance. The foot ounce has evolved as a practical unit for measuring torque in various fields, including automotive engineering, aviation, and manufacturing. Its use has become more prevalent with the advent of modern machinery and tools that require precise torque measurements.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to use the foot ounce in calculations, consider a scenario where a force of 16 ounces is applied at a distance of 2 feet from a pivot point. The torque can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Torque (ft·oz)} = \text{Force (oz)} \times \text{Distance (ft)} \]
\[ \text{Torque} = 16 \, \text{oz} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 32 \, \text{ft·oz} \]

This calculation demonstrates how to derive torque using the foot ounce unit effectively.

### Use of the Units
The foot ounce is primarily used in mechanical applications, such as adjusting bolts, screws, and other fasteners. It is particularly useful in automotive and aerospace industries, where precise torque specifications are crucial for safety and performance.
