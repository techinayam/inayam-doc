## Foot-Pound Per Second (ft·lb/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The foot-pound per second (ft·lb/s) is a unit of power that quantifies the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. Specifically, it measures the energy expended when one foot-pound of work is performed in one second. This unit is commonly used in engineering and physics to express mechanical power, particularly in the context of torque and rotational systems.

### Standardization
The foot-pound per second is part of the Imperial system of measurements, which is primarily used in the United States. It is defined as the power required to move one pound a distance of one foot in one second. This unit is often compared to other power units such as watts, where 1 ft·lb/s is approximately equal to 1.35582 watts.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring power dates back to the late 18th century when Scottish engineer James Watt introduced the term "horsepower" to describe the output of steam engines. The foot-pound per second emerged as a practical unit for measuring power in mechanical systems, especially in the context of engines and machinery.

### Example Calculation
To understand how to use the foot-pound per second, consider an example where a motor exerts a torque of 10 ft·lb at a rotational speed of 100 revolutions per minute (RPM). To calculate the power output in ft·lb/s, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Power (ft·lb/s)} = \frac{\text{Torque (ft·lb)} \times \text{RPM} \times 2\pi}{60} \]

In this case:

\[ \text{Power} = \frac{10 \times 100 \times 2\pi}{60} \approx 104.72 \text{ ft·lb/s} \]

### Use of the Units
The foot-pound per second is widely used in various fields, including mechanical engineering, automotive engineering, and physics. It helps engineers and technicians assess the performance of engines, motors, and other machinery by providing a clear understanding of power output.
