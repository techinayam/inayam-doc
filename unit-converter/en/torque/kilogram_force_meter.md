## Kilogram Force Meter (kgf·m) Tool Description

The **Kilogram Force Meter (kgf·m)** is a unit of torque that expresses the rotational force applied at a distance from a pivot point. This tool is essential for engineers, mechanics, and anyone involved in fields requiring precise calculations of torque. By converting various units of torque, users can ensure accuracy in their projects, whether they are designing machinery or performing routine maintenance.

### Definition
The kilogram force meter (kgf·m) is defined as the torque resulting from a force of one kilogram-force applied perpendicularly to a lever arm that is one meter long. This unit is commonly used in mechanical engineering and physics to quantify rotational forces.

### Standardization
The kilogram force meter is part of the metric system, which is standardized globally. It is essential for ensuring consistency in measurements across different applications and industries. The kgf·m is often used alongside other torque units such as Newton meters (Nm) and foot-pounds (ft·lb).

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has been around since the early days of mechanics, but the kilogram force meter became widely recognized in the 20th century with the advancement of engineering practices. Its use has evolved alongside technology, becoming a standard measurement in various fields, including automotive engineering and machinery design.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the kilogram force meter, consider a scenario where a force of 5 kgf is applied at the end of a lever arm that is 2 meters long. The torque can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Torque (kgf·m)} = \text{Force (kgf)} \times \text{Distance (m)} \]
\[ \text{Torque} = 5 \, \text{kgf} \times 2 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{kgf·m} \]
