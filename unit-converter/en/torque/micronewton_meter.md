## Micronewton Meter (µN·m) Tool Description

### Definition
The micronewton meter (µN·m) is a unit of torque that quantifies the rotational force applied at a distance. It is derived from the newton meter (N·m), where one micronewton is equal to one-millionth of a newton. This unit is particularly useful in precision engineering and scientific applications where small forces and moments are involved.

### Standardization
The micronewton meter is standardized within the International System of Units (SI). Torque is defined as the product of force and the distance from the pivot point, making it essential for calculations in mechanics, robotics, and various engineering fields.

### History and Evolution
The concept of torque has been around since the early days of physics, with significant contributions from scientists like Archimedes and Isaac Newton. The micronewton meter emerged as a practical unit as technology advanced, requiring more precise measurements in fields such as microengineering and nanotechnology.

### Example Calculation
To calculate torque in micronewton meters, use the formula:
\[ \text{Torque (µN·m)} = \text{Force (µN)} \times \text{Distance (m)} \]
For instance, if a force of 500 µN is applied at a distance of 0.02 m from the pivot, the torque would be:
\[ 500 \, \text{µN} \times 0.02 \, \text{m} = 10 \, \text{µN·m} \]

### Use of the Units
Micronewton meters are widely used in applications requiring precise torque measurements, such as in the calibration of instruments, testing of mechanical components, and in the design of sensitive equipment where small forces are critical.
