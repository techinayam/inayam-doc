## Astronomical Unit per Hour (AU/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The astronomical unit per hour (AU/h) is a unit of measurement used to express velocity in terms of astronomical units traveled in one hour. One astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun, roughly 149.6 million kilometers. This unit is particularly useful in astrophysics and astronomy, where distances between celestial bodies are vast and often measured in astronomical units.

### Standardization
The astronomical unit is a standard unit of measurement in the field of astronomy. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has defined the astronomical unit as precisely 149,597,870.7 kilometers. By standardizing this unit, scientists and researchers can communicate distances and velocities in a consistent manner, facilitating collaboration and understanding across various scientific disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The concept of the astronomical unit dates back to ancient civilizations, but it was not until the 17th century that it began to be used in a standardized way. The term "astronomical unit" was first coined in the 19th century, and its definition has evolved with advancements in technology and our understanding of the solar system. The introduction of the AU/h unit allows for a more practical application of this measurement in the context of time, making it easier to calculate velocities of celestial objects.

### Example Calculation
To convert a velocity from kilometers per hour (km/h) to astronomical units per hour (AU/h), you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{Velocity (AU/h)} = \frac{\text{Velocity (km/h)}}{149,597,870.7} \]

For example, if a spacecraft is traveling at a speed of 300,000 km/h, the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Velocity (AU/h)} = \frac{300,000}{149,597,870.7} \approx 0.00201 \text{ AU/h} \]

### Use of the Units
The AU/h unit is primarily used in astrophysics to describe the velocities of spacecraft, comets, and other celestial bodies. It allows astronomers to easily compare speeds and distances in a context that is meaningful within the vastness of space.
