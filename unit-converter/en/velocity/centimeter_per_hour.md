## Centimeter per Hour (cm/h) Tool Description

### Definition
The centimeter per hour (cm/h) is a unit of measurement for velocity, indicating how many centimeters an object travels in one hour. This metric is particularly useful in fields such as physics, engineering, and transportation, where precise measurements of speed are essential.

### Standardization
The centimeter per hour is part of the metric system, which is standardized globally. It is derived from the base unit of length, the meter, where 1 centimeter equals 0.01 meters. The hour is a standard unit of time, making cm/h a reliable measure for speed in various applications.

### History and Evolution
The centimeter as a unit of length was introduced in the late 18th century as part of the metric system, which aimed to provide a universal standard for measurements. Over time, the centimeter per hour has evolved to become a practical unit for measuring slow speeds, particularly in scientific experiments and certain industrial processes.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to convert kilometers per hour (km/h) to centimeters per hour (cm/h), consider a vehicle traveling at a speed of 60 km/h. 

1. **Conversion**: 
   - 60 km/h = 60,000 cm/h (since 1 km = 100,000 cm)
   
This example highlights how the centimeter per hour can be used to express speeds that may otherwise seem abstract in larger units.

### Use of the Units
The centimeter per hour is commonly used in various applications, including:
- Measuring the speed of slow-moving objects.
- Scientific research where precise measurements are required.
- Industrial processes that involve slow speeds, such as conveyor belts.
