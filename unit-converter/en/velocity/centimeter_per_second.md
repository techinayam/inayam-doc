## Centimeter Per Second (cm/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The centimeter per second (cm/s) is a unit of velocity that measures the distance traveled in centimeters over a period of one second. This metric is commonly used in various scientific fields, including physics and engineering, to express the speed of objects in a more granular manner than meters per second (m/s).

### Standardization
The centimeter per second is part of the metric system, which is an internationally recognized system of measurement. It is derived from the base unit of length, the meter, where 1 cm equals 0.01 meters. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy across different scientific and engineering applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring velocity dates back to the early studies of motion in physics. The centimeter per second unit has evolved alongside the metric system, which was established in France in the late 18th century. Over time, cm/s has become a preferred unit in many scientific disciplines due to its convenience for expressing small velocities.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate how to convert kilometers per hour (km/h) to centimeters per second (cm/s), consider a vehicle traveling at 90 km/h. The conversion can be done as follows:

1. Convert km/h to m/s: 
   \[
   90 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ h}}{3600 \text{ s}} = 25 \text{ m/s}
   \]

2. Convert m/s to cm/s: 
   \[
   25 \text{ m/s} \times \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ m}} = 2500 \text{ cm/s}
   \]

Thus, 90 km/h is equivalent to 2500 cm/s.

### Use of the Units
Centimeter per second is particularly useful in fields where precision is crucial, such as laboratory experiments, robotics, and fluid dynamics. It allows for detailed measurements that can be essential for accurate calculations and analyses.
