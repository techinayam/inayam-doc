## Meter per Second (m/s) Unit Converter

### Definition
The meter per second (m/s) is the standard unit of velocity in the International System of Units (SI). It quantifies the distance traveled in meters for every second of time elapsed. This unit is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and everyday applications, to measure speed and velocity.

### Standardization
The meter per second is standardized under the SI units, which are globally recognized and utilized for scientific and technical measurements. This standardization ensures consistency and accuracy in calculations across different disciplines and industries.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring speed dates back to ancient civilizations, but the formal definition of the meter was established in the late 18th century during the French Revolution. The meter per second became the standard unit of velocity as the metric system gained acceptance worldwide. Over the years, advancements in technology and science have further refined the understanding and application of velocity measurements.

### Example Calculation
To convert a speed of 90 kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s), you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{\text{Speed (km/h)}}{3.6} \]
Thus, \( 90 \, \text{km/h} \div 3.6 \approx 25 \, \text{m/s} \).

### Use of the Units
The meter per second is essential in various applications, such as:
- **Physics**: Analyzing motion and forces.
- **Engineering**: Designing transportation systems and machinery.
- **Sports**: Measuring athlete performance and speed.
- **Everyday Life**: Understanding speed limits and travel times.
