### Definition
The mile per hour (mph) is a unit of speed commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It quantifies the distance traveled in miles over the duration of one hour. This measurement is particularly relevant in transportation and travel, where understanding speed is crucial for safety and efficiency.

### Standardization
The mile per hour is standardized under the imperial system, where one mile is equivalent to 1,609.34 meters. This unit is widely recognized and utilized in various contexts, including road signs, vehicle speedometers, and aviation.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring speed dates back to ancient civilizations, but the mile as a unit of distance has its roots in Roman times. The mile was initially defined as 1,000 paces of a Roman soldier. Over time, the mile evolved, and the mile per hour became a standard unit for measuring speed, particularly in the context of land and air travel.

### Example Calculation
To convert 100 miles per hour to kilometers per hour, you can use the following formula:
\[ 
\text{Speed in km/h} = \text{Speed in mph} \times 1.60934 
\]
For example:
\[ 
100 \text{ mph} \times 1.60934 = 160.934 \text{ km/h} 
\]
