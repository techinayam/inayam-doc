## Nanometer per Second (nm/s) Tool Description

### Definition
The nanometer per second (nm/s) is a unit of measurement for velocity, representing the distance traveled in nanometers over the span of one second. This unit is particularly useful in fields such as nanotechnology, physics, and materials science, where measurements at the nanoscale are crucial for research and development.

### Standardization
The nanometer is a standardized unit in the International System of Units (SI), where 1 nanometer equals \(10^{-9}\) meters. The velocity expressed in nanometers per second allows scientists and engineers to quantify movement or propagation at incredibly small scales, making it essential for precise calculations in various scientific applications.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring distances at the nanoscale emerged in the late 20th century with advancements in microscopy and nanotechnology. As researchers began to manipulate and study materials at atomic and molecular levels, the need for precise velocity measurements in nanometers per second became apparent. This unit has since been adopted in various scientific disciplines, facilitating groundbreaking discoveries and innovations.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of nanometers per second, consider a particle that travels 500 nanometers in 2 seconds. The velocity can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{500 \, \text{nm}}{2 \, \text{s}} = 250 \, \text{nm/s}
\]
