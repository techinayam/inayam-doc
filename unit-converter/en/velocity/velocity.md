## Velocity Converter Tool

### Definition
Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to the rate at which an object changes its position. It is measured in units of distance per time, with the standard unit being meters per second (m/s). This tool allows users to convert velocity measurements across various units, including kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph), and more. Understanding velocity is crucial in fields such as physics, engineering, and everyday applications like driving and sports.

### Standardization
The International System of Units (SI) defines the meter per second (m/s) as the standard unit for measuring velocity. Other common units include kilometers per hour (km/h) and miles per hour (mph). This tool ensures that users can easily convert between these units, promoting consistency and accuracy in measurements.

### History and Evolution
The concept of velocity dates back to ancient civilizations, where it was primarily understood in terms of speed. Over the centuries, the scientific community has refined the definition and measurement of velocity, integrating it into the broader study of motion. The development of the metric system in the 18th century further standardized velocity measurements, making it easier for scientists and engineers to communicate their findings.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of the velocity converter, consider a car traveling at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour. To convert this speed to meters per second, you would use the following formula:

\[ 
\text{Velocity (m/s)} = \text{Velocity (km/h)} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{3600 \text{ s}} 
\]

Thus, 100 km/h is approximately 27.78 m/s.

### Use of the Units
Velocity is essential in various applications, including:
- **Transportation**: Calculating travel times and speeds.
- **Physics**: Analyzing motion and forces.
- **Sports**: Measuring the speed of athletes and vehicles.
