## Fluid Ounce per Square Foot (fl oz/ft²) Tool Description

### Definition
The fluid ounce per square foot (fl oz/ft²) is a unit of measurement used to express the volume of liquid applied over a specific area. This metric is particularly useful in fields such as construction, agriculture, and culinary arts, where the application of liquids over surfaces is common.

### Standardization
Fluid ounces are standardized measurements in the United States customary and imperial systems. One fluid ounce is equivalent to approximately 29.5735 milliliters. When measuring over an area, the fluid ounce per square foot provides a clear understanding of how much liquid is distributed across a given surface.

### History and Evolution
The fluid ounce has its origins in the medieval period, evolving from various local measures of volume. The square foot, a unit of area, has been used since the Roman Empire, making the combination of these two units a practical solution for measuring liquid applications across surfaces.

### Example Calculation
To illustrate the use of fluid ounces per square foot, consider a scenario where you need to apply a liquid fertilizer to a garden bed measuring 10 square feet. If the recommended application rate is 2 fl oz/ft², you would calculate the total volume needed as follows:

- Total Volume = Application Rate × Area
- Total Volume = 2 fl oz/ft² × 10 ft² = 20 fl oz

### Use of the Units
Fluid ounces per square foot is commonly used in various industries:
- **Agriculture**: For applying fertilizers and pesticides.
- **Construction**: For measuring coatings or sealants spread over surfaces.
- **Culinary**: In recipes where liquid ingredients need to be distributed evenly over a surface.
