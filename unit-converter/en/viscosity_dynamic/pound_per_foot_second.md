### 1. Definition
Dynamic viscosity is a measure of a fluid's internal resistance to flow. The unit pound per foot second (lb/(ft·s)) quantifies this resistance, indicating how much force is required to move a fluid at a certain rate. 

### 2. Standardization
The pound per foot second is part of the imperial system of units, commonly used in the United States. It is standardized for various applications in engineering and fluid mechanics, ensuring consistent measurements across different fields.

### 3. History and Evolution
The concept of viscosity dates back to the work of Sir Isaac Newton, who first described the relationship between shear stress and shear rate in fluids. The lb/(ft·s) unit has evolved alongside the development of fluid dynamics, becoming a standard measurement in many industrial applications.

### 4. Example Calculation
To convert 10 lb/(ft·s) to pascal seconds (Pa·s), you can use the conversion factor: 
1 lb/(ft·s) = 47.8803 Pa·s. 
Thus, 10 lb/(ft·s) = 10 * 47.8803 = 478.803 Pa·s.

### 5. Use of the Units
The lb/(ft·s) unit is widely used in industries such as petroleum, food processing, and pharmaceuticals, where understanding fluid behavior is crucial for product formulation and quality control.
