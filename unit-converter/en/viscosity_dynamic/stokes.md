## Stokes (St) - Dynamic Viscosity Unit Converter

### Definition
Stokes (St) is a unit of measurement for kinematic viscosity, which quantifies a fluid's resistance to flow under the influence of gravity. It is defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to fluid density. The higher the Stokes value, the thicker the fluid, indicating a greater resistance to flow.

### Standardization
Stokes is standardized in the International System of Units (SI) and is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications. One Stokes is equivalent to one square centimeter per second (cm²/s). This standardization allows for consistent measurement and comparison across different fluids and applications.

### History and Evolution
The term "Stokes" is named after the Irish mathematician and physicist George Gabriel Stokes, who made significant contributions to fluid dynamics in the 19th century. The unit has evolved over time, becoming a standard in various industries, including engineering, chemistry, and physics, for assessing fluid behavior.

### Example Calculation
To convert dynamic viscosity from centipoise (cP) to Stokes, you can use the following formula:

\[ \text{St} = \frac{\text{cP}}{\text{Density (g/cm}^3\text{)}} \]

For example, if a fluid has a dynamic viscosity of 10 cP and a density of 0.8 g/cm³:

\[ \text{St} = \frac{10 \text{ cP}}{0.8 \text{ g/cm}^3} = 12.5 \text{ St} \]

### Use of the Units
Stokes is widely used in industries such as petroleum, food processing, and pharmaceuticals, where understanding fluid viscosity is crucial for processes like mixing, pumping, and quality control. By converting viscosity measurements into Stokes, engineers and scientists can make informed decisions regarding fluid behavior in various applications.
