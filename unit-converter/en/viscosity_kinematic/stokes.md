## Stokes (St) - Kinematic Viscosity Unit Converter

### Definition
Stokes (St) is a unit of measurement for kinematic viscosity, which quantifies a fluid's internal resistance to flow under the influence of gravity. It is defined as the kinematic viscosity of a fluid that has a dynamic viscosity of one centipoise and a density of one gram per cubic centimeter. In simpler terms, it helps in understanding how easily a fluid flows.

### Standardization
The Stokes unit is part of the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system of units. It is commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications, particularly in fields such as fluid mechanics, chemical engineering, and materials science. The standardization of Stokes allows for consistent communication and calculations across different disciplines.

### History and Evolution
The term "Stokes" is named after the Irish mathematician and physicist George Gabriel Stokes, who contributed significantly to the study of fluid dynamics in the 19th century. The unit has evolved over time, with its application expanding into various industries, including petroleum, food processing, and pharmaceuticals.

### Example Calculation
To convert kinematic viscosity from centistokes (cSt) to Stokes (St), you can use the following formula:
\[ \text{Kinematic Viscosity (St)} = \frac{\text{Kinematic Viscosity (cSt)}}{100} \]
For example, if a fluid has a kinematic viscosity of 200 cSt, its viscosity in Stokes would be:
\[ \text{Kinematic Viscosity (St)} = \frac{200}{100} = 2 \text{ St} \]

### Use of the Units
Stokes is widely used in industries that require precise measurements of fluid flow characteristics. Applications include:
- **Petroleum Industry**: Determining the flow properties of crude oil and refined products.
- **Food Processing**: Assessing the viscosity of sauces, oils, and other liquid food products.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Ensuring the proper consistency of liquid medications.
