## Milliliter (mL) Converter Tool

### Definition
A milliliter (mL) is a metric unit of volume that is commonly used in various fields, including cooking, chemistry, and medicine. It is defined as one-thousandth of a liter, making it a precise measurement for small quantities of liquid.

### Standardization
The milliliter is part of the International System of Units (SI) and is standardized to ensure consistency across scientific and practical applications. This standardization allows for accurate conversions and comparisons between different volume measurements, making it essential for professionals and everyday users alike.

### History and Evolution
The concept of measuring volume dates back to ancient civilizations, but the metric system, which includes the milliliter, was developed in France during the late 18th century. The milliliter has since become a universal standard for measuring liquid volumes, facilitating international trade and scientific research.

### Example Calculation
To convert milliliters to liters, simply divide the number of milliliters by 1,000. For example, if you have 500 mL of liquid, the conversion to liters would be:
\[ 
500 \, \text{mL} \div 1000 = 0.5 \, \text{L} 
\]

### Use of the Units
Milliliters are widely used in various applications, such as:
- **Cooking and Baking**: Accurate measurement of ingredients.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: Dosage of liquid medications.
- **Laboratories**: Precise measurements in experiments.
