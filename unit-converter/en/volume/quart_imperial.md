### Example Calculation
To illustrate the conversion from quarts to liters, consider the following example: 
If you have 2 quarts of liquid, you can convert it to liters using the formula:
\[ \text{Liters} = \text{Quarts} \times 1.136 \]
Thus, 
\[ 2 \text{ quarts} \times 1.136 = 2.272 \text{ liters} \]

### Use of the Units
